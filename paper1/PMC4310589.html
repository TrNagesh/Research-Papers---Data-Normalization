<p>Human gastric epithelial AGS (purchased from ATCC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells were cultured and maintained in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS at 37&#176;C. Mesencephalic dopaminergic rat cell lines (CSM14.1, a gift from Bernd Evert, University of Bonn) conditionally expressing vector alone or WT human ATXN3 (Q23) or pathological ATXN3 (Q70) were cultured and maintained at 33&#176;C in DMEM with 10% FBS containing 0.1 mg/ml G418, 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin, 4.0 ug/ml puromycin and 1.0 &#956;g/ml tetracycline as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref035">35</xref>].</p><p>The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (ATCC number CRL-2266) was cultured at 37&#176;C in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/high glucose nutrient (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biochrom), 2 mM glutaMAX (Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 &#956;g/mL streptomycin. To generate ATXN3-depleted cells, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with an shRNA sequence targeting <italic>ATXN3</italic> or a scrambled shRNA sequence, as described elsewhere and the stably transduced cells were selected 48 h post-transfection with 500 ng/ml puromycin. Stably infected cell lines were cultured and maintained as described earlier in presence of 25 ng/mL puromycin (Sigma Aldrich). The medium was changed every two days. Differentiation was induced by exposure to 0.1 &#956;M all-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Sigma Aldrich) in opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 7 days; the medium was replaced every two days.</p><p>PNKP and ATXN3 depletion was carried out in HEK-293 cells using siRNAs (80 nM) purchased from Sigma (SASI_Hs01_00067475) and Dharmacon (On-target siRNA, J-012013-05), respectively. The control siRNA was purchased from Sigma (Mission universal control, SIC001). The cells were harvested 60 h post-transfection and nuclear extracts were prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref057">57</xref>].</p><p>A large-scale immunoprecipitation from AGS (gastric epithelial) cell nuclear extracts (100 mg, benzonase treated to remove DNA and RNA to avoid DNA-mediated co-immunoprecipitation) used mouse IgG (control) and anti-PNKP antibody (mouse monoclonal Ab, Cytostore)- conjugated agarose beads as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref058">58</xref>]. The immunoprecipitates (IPs) were washed extensively with cold TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 200 mM NaCl) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. The complexes were then eluted from the beads stepwise with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 300, 400 and 500 mM NaCl. The eluates were subjected to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) separation and the protein spots (Sypro Ruby, Molecular Probes) that were specifically present in the PNKP IP and not in the IgG IP were subjected to mass spectroscopic identification in the University of Texas Medical Branch Biomolecular Resource Facility.</p><p>Co-IP analysis was performed from HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells according to established protocol by Aygun et al, with modifications as applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref057">57</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>In situ</italic> Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) between PNKP (anti-mouse Ab, a gift from Michael Weinfeld) and ATXN3 (anti-rabbit Ab, Proteintech) was carried out according to the protocol as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref058">58</xref>] using a Duolink PLA kit (QLink Bioscience Cat# LNK 92101 K101, Uppsala, Sweden).</p><p>The 3&#8217;-phosphatase activity of PNKP in the nuclear extract or with purified recombinant PNKP was assayed as we described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref059">59</xref>].</p><p>Genomic DNA from HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells was extracted using the Qiagen Genomic-tip 20/G kit per the manufacturer&#8217;s directions. This kit is particularly useful, as it minimizes DNA oxidation during the isolation step and has been previously used for LA-QPCR assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref038">38</xref>]. For isolation of genomic DNA from postmortem brain tissues, we followed the protocol of Kovtun et al. as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref060">60</xref>]. To decrease aerial oxidation during genomic DNA preparation, TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-<italic>N</italic>-oxyl) was added to all solutions at a concentration of 100&#956;M immediately before use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref060">60</xref>]. The DNA was quantitated by Pico Green (Molecular Probes) in a 96-well plate. Gene-specific LA-QPCR assays for measuring DNA SBs were performed as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref033">33</xref>] using LongAmp Taq DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs). A 10.4 kb region of the <italic>HPRT</italic> gene or 12.2 kb of the <italic>POLB</italic> gene was amplified from human genomic DNA using the primers described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref038">38</xref>]. To ensure the linearity of PCR amplification with respect to the number of cycles and DNA concentration, preliminary assays were carried out. Since amplification of a small region would be independent of DNA damage, a small DNA fragment from the same gene was also amplified for normalization of amplification of the large fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref033">33</xref>]. The amplified products were then visualized on gels and quantitated with ImageJ software system. The extent of damage was calculated in terms of lesion/10 kb genome following Poisson&#8217;s distribution according to methods as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref034">34</xref>].</p><p>We received the bacterial expression vectors for ATXN3-Q29 (WT) and ATXN3-Q72 (mutant) as a kind gift from Randall Pittman (Univ. of Pennsylvania) and purified both recombinant proteins as described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref020">20</xref>]. WT PNKP and its domains were purified as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref058">58</xref>].

Briefly, GST-tagged full-length PNKP or its three individual domains (20 pmol) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 &#956;L), washed thoroughly with buffer A (25 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol) containing 150 mM NaCl, and then incubated with WT or mutant ATXN3 (20 pmol) with constant rocking for 4 h. at 4&#176;C in 0.5 ml of 150 mM salt containing buffer A. After extensive washing with 200 mM NaCl containing buffer A, 20% of the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis using an anti-ATXN3 Ab (Abcam).</p><p>CMVMJD135 mice, expressing human ataxin-3 carrying 135 glutamines, were used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref037">37</xref>]. These mice display a progressive motor phenotype starting at an age of 6 weeks, with extensive phenotypic overlap with the human disease; they also develop ATXN3-positive neuronal inclusions in different regions of the brain and spinal cord, as well as a cell number and/or volume decrease in key regions for the disease, such as the pontine nuclei and the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Transgenic mice and control non-transgenic littermate mice (n = 5 per genotype) with a mean age of 25 weeks were sacrificed by decapitation, and brain slices were obtained for the macrodissection of pontine nuclei, substantia nigra, deep cerebellar nuclei and hippocampi using a stereomicroscope (Model SZX7, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA). Nuclear extracts from these different brain regions were obtained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004749.ref062">62</xref>].</p>
