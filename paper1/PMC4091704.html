To identify the causative mutation, the mutation was outcrossed to strain C3HeB/FeJ (&#8220;C3H&#8221;), then intercrossed to produce potential homozygotes. F2 offspring were screened for micronucleus levels and a genome scan with a collection of microsatellite markers polymorphic between C3H and the parental strain B6 was performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004471-Moran1">[28]</xref>. This localized <italic>Chaos4</italic> to a 44-Mb interval on chromosome 12, between <italic>D12Mit285</italic> and <italic>D12Mit71</italic>. Subsequently, we conducted an inter-subspecific mapping cross with <italic>Mus castaneus</italic> (CAST/Ei). The F1s were either intercrossed or backcrossed to CAST/Ei and scored for micronuclei. A total of 956 informative meioses were examined, defining a 9-Mb critical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004471-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The XH297 ES cell line (derived from the 129/Ola strain; BayGenomics) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004471-Stryke1">[76]</xref> bearing a gene trap insertion of <italic>Fancm</italic> (abbreviated <italic>Fancm<sup>XH</sup></italic>) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 15% FBS (HyClone), 0.1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml), 100 &#181;M beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (produced in-house).

PCR products were then digested by restriction enzyme <italic>Aci</italic>I, which is present in the <italic>Chaos4</italic> allele only. The <italic>Chaos4</italic> allele is cut into 180 bp and 60 bp fragments. Genotyping of <italic>Fancm<sup>XH</sup></italic> mice was performed indirectly using microsatellite markers <italic>D12Mit69</italic> and <italic>D12Mit71</italic> that flank <italic>Fancm</italic>, and which are polymorphic between strain C3H and B6 (B6 alleles at <italic>D12Mit69</italic> and <italic>D12Mit71</italic> are indicative of the <italic>Chaos4</italic> allele).
