<p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">All worm strains were maintained at 20&#176;C on MYOB plates seeded with OP50. The strains used in these experiments are listed in supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006543.s010">S1 Table</xref>. To monitor the effect of the <italic>sds-22(bs9)</italic> mutation on centriole duplication <italic>sds-22(bs9)</italic> homozygotes were selected from the OC626 strain using the visible <italic>dpy</italic> marker which is closely linked to the <italic>sds-22</italic> gene. RNAi of SZY-2 was carried out by soaking worms in dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref064">64</xref>], all other RNAi experiments were carried out by feeding worms bacteria expressing dsRNA as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref065">65</xref>]. Briefly, bacteria containing the RNAi construct were grown overnight and seeded onto MYOB plates supplemented with 25ug/ml ampicillin and 1mM IPTG. For double RNAi a 50:50 mix of overnight cultures of the two bacterial strains was plated. Worms were placed on RNAi at the L4 stage for 28h before analysis. The sequence contained in the GSP-1 RNAi construct was evaluated using the Clone mapper tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://bioinformatics.lif.univ-mrs.fr/RNAiMap/index.html">http://bioinformatics.lif.univ-mrs.fr/RNAiMap/index.html</ext-link>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref066">66</xref>], which confirmed likely specificity for only the <italic>gsp-1</italic> gene. For control RNAi we used an <italic>smd-1</italic>-containing vector.</p><p>Embryonic extracts for western blots were prepared and analyzed as detailed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref059">59</xref>]. Whole worm extracts for the immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were made according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref067">67</xref>]. Total protein concentration was determined using the Biorad Protein Assay Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad). 1.6 mg of total protein from N2 worms was used for performing each IP. Briefly, for each IP, 30 &#956;l of Dynabeads Protein A (Life Technologies) were incubated with 10 &#956;g of each respective antibody at 4&#176;C for 2 hours. Beads were washed three times in worm lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.05% NP-40), re-suspended in 2X Laemmli Buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled at 100&#176;C for 2 minutes and analyzed by western blotting. The following antibodies/reagents were used in this study: polyclonal SZY-2 antibodies were raised and purified against the entire <italic>szy-2</italic> ORF (Covance); GSP-1 antibodies were raised and purified against the peptide CQYQGMNSGRPAVGGGRPGTTAGKK (YenZym Antibodies LLC); ZYG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref053">53</xref>], phospho-histone H3 (Abcam); GSP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref068">68</xref>]; DM1A (Sigma). Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out by the NIDDK mass spec core facility.</p><p>RNA was extracted from wild-type and <italic>szy-2(bs4)</italic> embryos, DNase treated and cDNA made using a superscriptIII first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Forward (ACAGTACGCGGAAGAAATGG) and reverse (CACAGCAACCATCTTTTGGA) primers were used to amplify <italic>zyg-1</italic>. Primers against <italic>ama-1</italic> were used as a control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref069">69</xref>]. qRT reactions used iQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad) as directed by the manufacturer.</p><p>Fixation and staining of embryos was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref036">36</xref>]. The following antibodies were used at a 1/1000 dilution: DM1A (Sigma), phospho-histone H3 (Abcam), ZYG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref019">19</xref>], SPD-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref050">50</xref>] and anti-SAS-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref053">53</xref>]. For live and fixed imaging we used a spinning disk confocal microscope which has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006543.ref061">61</xref>]. To determine whether PP1 affects translation of the ZYG-1 transcript we shifted worms carrying the reporter construct to 25&#176;C as L4s and imaged embryos the next day. Intensities of chromatin GFP at first metaphase were measured using Metamorph. Levels of ZYG-1 or SPD-2 at the centrosome were determined by quantification of average pixel intensity at the centrosome. Maximal projections of the centrosome were used for quantification of fluorescence in ImageJ 1.40g and background fluorescence was subtracted. Centrosome fluorescence was normalized to controls such that control intensity is 1. For structured illumination microscopy, embryos were immuno-labeled as usual and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Samples were imaged with a DeltaVision OMX4 SIM Imaging System (Applied Precision).</p>
