<p>The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004010.s009">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004010.s010">S3</xref>. Strains were generated by using a standard PCR-mediated gene insertion/deletion technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004010-Longtine1">[54]</xref>. Cells were grown in standard YPD or SD medium supplemented with amino acids and all lipids were prepared by resuspending in either ethanol or methanol and storing under nitrogen gas.</p><p>All strains were grown in YPD or minimal media supplemented with appropriate amino acids as required and treated with PC(<italic>O</italic>-16:0/2:0) (Enzo Life Sciences, BML-L100 or Avanti Polar Lipids, 878119P) at 20 &#181;M for 15 minutes unless indicated otherwise. Media was supplemented with rapamycin (200 ng/ml) where indicated.</p><p>Cells were grown in YPD or minimal media at 30 C to mid-log phase and resuspended to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1. Dot assays were performed by spotting 4 &#181;L of ten-fold serial dilutions (OD<sub>600</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001) onto YPD or minimal media selection plates containing the specified concentrations of ethanol, PC(<italic>O</italic>-16:0/2:0) or other chemical as indicated.</p><p>For all microscopy experiments, overnight cultures grown at 30 C in YPD medium were re-suspended at a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 and allowed to reach mid-log phase prior treatment and image acquisition. Live cell imaging was performed by briefly centrifuging the cells (800 g for 3 min), followed by resuspending in a minimal volume of growth media, spotting onto glass slides and coverslipping prior to imaging. All images were acquired using a Leica DMI 6000 florescent microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzler Germany), equipped with a Sutter DG4 light source (Sutter Instruments, California, USA), Ludl emission filter wheel with Chroma band pass emission filters (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd., NY, USA) and Hamamatsu Orca AG camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany). Images were acquired at 0.2 &#181;M steps using a 63&#215; oil-immersion objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture. Deconvolution and analysis were performed using Velocity Software V4 (Perkin Elmer). For most images, representative images of the middle section and compressed image stack are shown. Numerical insets represent the indicated quantifications of at least 100 cells from 2 to 3 independent experiments unless indicated otherwise.</p><p>Early log phase cells were fixed by diluting 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7% and incubating at 25 C for 10 minutes. Cells were subsequently pelleted (800 g for 3 min) and resuspended in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated for 1 hour. Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS prior to staining with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween on ice (20 Units/ml, Invitrogen) and cells were washed two times prior to imaging. For actin depolymerisation, Latrunculin A (5 &#181;M, Tocris) was added as indicated prior to fixation and cell staining.</p><p>In all cases overnight cultures of yeast strains were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 in YPD or appropriate minimal media and allowed to reach mid-log growth prior to harvesting. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 &#181;L of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA with phosphatase and protease inhibitors and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Ypk1 was examined in ethanol and PC(<italic>O</italic>-16:0/2:0) treated cells prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004010-Berchtold2">[37]</xref>. Briefly, ice cold acetone was added to mid log phase cells and incubate on ice for 5 min. Cells were pelleted and washed two times in 5% acetone in PBS. Supernatant was removed and the cells pellets were dried under vacuum prior to lysis in urea buffer.</p><p>Processing for electron microscopy was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004010-Griffith1">[55]</xref>.</p><p>TORC2 was purified from RL127-1c cells. The cultures were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 5.0 in YPD (125 mL per assay point), chilled on ice for 30 minutes, collected, and washed. The cells were put into liquid nitrogen and ground up using a mortar and pestle. The powder was then resuspended in lysis buffer (1&#215; Roche protease inhibitor +EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, phosphatase inhibitors, 5 mM CHAPS, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl), spun down, and 420 ul of prepared paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy, coated with rabbit IgG; Sigma) were added to the cleared protein extracts. The tubes were subsequently rotated for 3 h at 4&#176;C. Beads were collected by using a magnet and washed extensively with lysis buffer. The kinase reactions were performed in a final volume of 30 &#181;l containing TORC2-coupled beads, 300 ng of Ypk2, 25 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 0.5% Tween20, 1&#215; Roche protease inhibitor-EDTA, 100 mM ATP, 5 mCi [&#947;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and 1 &#181;l of inhibitors at various concentrations. PAF was dissolved in EtOH and used at the indicated concentrations. Assays were started with addition of ATP, maintained at 30&#176;C for 25 minutes and terminated by the addition of 7.5 &#181;l of 5&#215; SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were heated at 65&#176;C for 10 min; proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE, stained with Sypro Ruby and analysed using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager.</p><p>GST-Ypk2 fusion proteins were expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from a pRS426 vector. Actively growing cells were induced for 3 hours with galactose (final concentration of 2%), chilled on ice for 30 minutes, and collected. The cells were put into liquid nitrogen and ground up using a mortar and pestle. The powder was then resuspended in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1&#215;PBS, 0.5% Tween, 1&#215; Roche protease inhibitor +EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and phosphatase inhibitors) and the fusion protein was bound to and eluted from glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) following standard procedures. The supernatant was dialyzed against ( 50% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl), aliquotted, and frozen at &#8722;20&#176;C.</p><p>Cells at 0.6 OD<sub>600</sub> were treated with 20 &#181;M PAF or ethanol as a control. At T&#8202;=&#8202;15 min, 30 min , 60 min and 120 min, 7.5 OD<sub>600</sub> were harvested in glass tubes, washed with water and the pellet was extracted 3&#215;1 ml in water&#8758;Ethanol&#8758;Diethyl Ether&#8758;Pyridine&#8758;NH4OH (15&#8758;15&#8758;5&#8758;1&#8758;0.018) at 65&#176;C for 15 min each time. Avanti Polar Lipid MS standards (LM-6002) were added during the first extraction at 62.5 pmol/tube. The extracts were pooled and dried under N2, redissolved in 1 ml Chloroform with bath sonication, 1 ml Butanol was added and phospholipids were hydrolyzed for 30 min at 37&#176;C after the addition of 200 &#181;L 1 M KOH (in methanol). After hydrolysis, the extract was neutralized by the addition of 200 &#181;L 1 M Acetic Acid (in Methanol). 1 ml Butanol saturated water was added, centrifuged to separate the phases and the upper aqueous layer was removed by aspiration, being careful not to disrupt the precipitate at the interface. This was repeated two more times after which the remaining lower phase was dried under N2. The dried lipid was redissolved in 0.5 ml LC/MS buffer A with bath sonication, spun to pellet insoluble material and the transferred to MS analysis vials.</p><p>The samples were analyzed on a Supelco Discovery Bio Wide Pore C18 (5 cm&#215;2.1 mm, 5 uM) column at 40&#176;C (50 mm) using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC coupled to ABSciex QTRAP 4000 MS. The LCB(P)s were eluted using a binary solvent gradient of 0% B for 1 min, 25% at 4 min, 100% at 4.5 min and held at 100%B for 1.5 min, 0%B at 7 min. The LCB(P)s were detected in MRM mode,</p><p>MS buffer A: Tetrahydrofuran: Methanol: 10 mM Ammonium Formate (30&#8758;20&#8758;50) with 0.2% Formic Acid</p><p>MS buffer B: Tetrahydrofuran: Methanol: 10 mM Ammonium Formate (70&#8758;20&#8758;10) with 0.2% Formic Acid</p>
