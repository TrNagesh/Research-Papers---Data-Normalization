Nine Mapuche and nine Aymara individuals were selected to represent the two largest indigenous peoples in Chile based on the three following criteria: four grandparental Mapuche or Aymara surnames, estimated Native American proportion of at least 74% for Mapuche and at least 99% for Aymara reference individuals, and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups consistent with Mapuche (haplogroup C or D) or Aymara (haplogroup B) descent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006756.ref041">41</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006756.t001">Table 1</xref> shows demographic characteristics of the 1805 individuals in the aggregate-data study. The median age of study participants was 27 years and 39% were women. 2% belonged to the ABC1 socioeconomic group (high middle class) and 27% to the D/E stratum (semi- and un-skilled manual occupations, unemployed and lowest grade occupations). The Chilean regions with the largest numbers of participants were De Arica y Parinacota (44% of subjects), Metropolitana de Santiago (17%) and Del Biob&#237;o (9%). About 2/3 of recruited subjects were professional soldiers, with a relatively large proportion of men born in the south of Chile (Del Maule, Del Biob&#237;o and De la Araucan&#237;a regions). Traditionally, the majority of professional soldiers are recruited from among the middle classes, with minorities from the social elite (officer corps) and the lowest socioeconomic groups (illiterate citizens), representing well the general Chilean population.

Age-standardized mortality and incidence rates were calculated for each region with respect to the Chilean population census data from 2002.

Both arrays include at least 700,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Intentional duplicates and arrays with more than 5% missing genotypes were excluded. Genetic variants were filtered to exclude non-autosomal polymorphisms, variants with a missing call rate over 5%, and also variants with a minor allele frequency under 5%.

Regional ancestry estimates were assumed to be normally distributed with means equal to the expected regional ancestry proportions, and variances proportional to the corresponding standard errors.

Variants with overlapping 80% CIs in European and HGDP reference groups, and with overlapping 80% CIs in European and Mapuche reference individuals were excluded from subsequent sensitivity analyses.
