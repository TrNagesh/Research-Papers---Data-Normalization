Alternatively, cortical neurons in primary culture were incubated for 5 h in the presence or absence of 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) added to the culture medium. Cells were then scraped from the plate in phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.5, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was than transferred to a fresh tube. Human fibroblasts plated on 100-mm dishes were lysed in 0.8 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 0.8% v/v Triton X-100, 75 mM NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitors (EDTA-free Complete; Roche). Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay reagent. Samples were denatured at 95&#176;C or 50&#176;C (for ATG9A) for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma Aldrich) or 3% dry milk (BioRad) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (KD Medical) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), probed with different primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and revealed with either SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher) or Western Lighting Plus (PerkinElmer, Inc.).</p><p>Young WT and AP-4 &#949; KO mice (PND 1&#8211;18) were initially screened using the SHIRPA protocol for general health measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007363.ref062">62</xref>] and found not to differ. Cohorts of 8&#8211;25 adult (2&#8211;8 month old) male and female mice were subsequently tested in a battery of behavioral assays to examine motor, motorsensory and higher order neurological functions, including clasping, grip strength, rotarod, open field, startle response, elevated plus maze, spontaneous T-maze and Barnes maze. Animals were sex and age matched for each experiment. D&#8217;Agostino normality test was used to calculate the number of mice needed per group and for subsequent statistical analysis using t-test and two-way ANOVA for repeated measures followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test.</p><p>Clasping. WT and KO mice were suspended by the tail for 15 s at 20 cm height from the procedure table and the posture of hindlimbs was visually examined. The response was considered clasping if one or both hindlimbs were retracted and touched the abdomen for more that 3 s during the suspension. On the other hand, if the hindlimbs remained splayed outward during the entire time of suspension, we considered the mouse as non-clasping.</p><p>Grip Strength. To evaluate neuromuscular function, we assessed the maximal grabbing force (in Newton, N) exerted by mice when pulled out of a 45&#176; grid connected to a force meter (BIO-GS3; Bioseb). The grip strength of all four paws was tested at the same time in three consecutive measurements per mouse, and the grip strength calculated as the average of each measurement.</p><p>Rotarod. The accelerating rotarod test was used to assess balance and motor coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007363.ref063">63</xref>]. Briefly, WT and KO mice were placed on a five-lane rotarod device (ENV-574M, Med Associates Inc.). Mice were started at 4 RPM for 10 s, and speed was progressively accelerated to 40 RPM in 5 min. An infrared beam at the bottom of the rotor automatically recorded the time when mice fell from the rod. Rotarod performance was scored in three consecutive trials per mouse.</p><p>Open Field. Novelty-induced locomotor activity of WT and AP-4 &#949; KO mice was recorded in an illuminated (200 lux) white square arena (50 x 50 cm, 35 cm high walls) every 5 min for a total of 30 min. Horizontal locomotor activity was video recorded and distance traveled scored using Any-Maze software V5.1 (Stoelting Co). The open field arena was wiped with 70% v/v ethanol between trials.</p><p>Startle response. Acoustic startle response was measured during a 30 min session in Plexiglas cylinders in ventilated sound-attenuating chambers and with 65 dB white noise background (San Diego Instruments). After a 5-min habituation period, WT and KO mice were presented with a total of 260 trials with pseudo-randomized inter-trial periods (5&#8211;25 s) consisting of acoustic startle trials with white noise bursts of various intensities (65 to 120 dB; 10 trials per intensity). In each trial, the highest startle intensity peak (in arbitrary units designated by the apparatus) was measured during the 100 ms interval after the startle stimulus, from which the individual mean highest startle intensity peak during the 100-ms null-period was recorded.</p><p>Elevated Plus Maze. The elevated plus maze was used to assess basal anxiety and risk-taking behaviors. Experiments were performed on a Plexiglas plus-shaped maze containing two dark enclosed arms and two open arms elevated 50 cm above ground. Each of the four arms was 30 x 5 cm and were connected to a 5 x 5 cm center arena, and the walls of the closed arms were 20 cm high. Trials started by placing WT and KO mice in the center of the maze and the exploratory activity was tracked by video recording for 5 min. The total time mice spent in the closed/open arms, and at the center of the maze, were scored by Any-Maze software (Stoelting). The plus maze was cleaned between trials with 70% v/v alcohol.</p><p>T-Maze. Short-term spatial memory was assessed in a T-maze to test for spontaneous exploratory working memory behaviors, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007363.ref064">64</xref>]. Briefly, the T-shaped maze consisted of three 23 cm-long arms. The mouse was placed in the &#8220;start arm&#8221; and allowed to explore any of the remaining two &#8220;goal arms&#8221; of its preference. Once a mouse entered either the left or right goal arm (four paws and tail inside an arm), a door to restrict the mouse exploration to this arm was lowered during 30 sec. The mouse was immediately returned to the start arm and allowed again to freely explore the apparatus. If during the second trial the mouse decided to explore the previously unvisited remaining arm, &#8220;alternation&#8221; of behavior was recorded. Three sessions were recorded per mouse with a delay time of 90 min each, and percentage of alternation was scored.</p><p>Barnes Maze. The Barnes maze test was conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007363.ref065">65</xref>]. The apparatus consisted of a white circular platform (92 cm diameter) with 20 equally spaced holes (5 cm diameter, 7.5 cm between holes) along the perimeter and elevated 100 cm above the floor. One hole was designated as escape hole, and provided access to an escape box containing a metal stairway for easy access that was not visible unless mice approached the hole closely. During the test, mice received aversive reinforcements (85 dB background noise and 900 lux bright light) to encourage escape behaviors from the maze. Following a habituation period (30 min), the test consisted of two phases: training (spatial acquisition) and testing (probe trial). The training phase consisted of 4 trials/day/mouse during four consecutive days with inter-trial periods of 30 min each. The duration of each trial was 3 min. During the training phase, both the time that the mice spent finding the target box (latency time) and the number of errors (nose pokes in any no target hole) for each trial were scored from day 1 to 4. The testing phase was run 24 h after conclusion of the training phase (day 5), and consisted of one single trial of 90 s of duration per mouse. In this case, the target box was taken away from the maze so that the mouse was unable to escape from the maze and the number of nose pokes in the escape/incorrect holes and the time in the correct zone (&#188; of the platform area including two incorrect holes at each side of escape) were recorded. Latency time, number of nose pokes in holes and time in the correct zone were automatically measured with AnyMaze program (Stoelting Co.). The chamber was wiped between trials with a 70% v/v alcohol.</p><p>MRI was performed as per ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007363.ref066">66</xref>]. MRI data were acquired using a 14.1 T magnetic resonance microimaging system with an 89-mm vertical superconducting magnet (Bruker Spectrospin) and a Bruker Avance III NMR imaging console controlled by Paravision 5.1 software (Bruker Instruments) with a 35 mm ID actively shielded gradients. A 20 mm ID birdcage volume RF resonator was used in these experiments. 3D MR images were acquired using a standard multi-echo spin-echo 3D RARE sequence with an echo time (TE) of 6.837 ms and a repetition time (TR) of 200 ms, a RARE factor of 2, 1 average, and an acquisition bandwidth of 119.047 kHz. The image field of view was 20 x 13 x 13 mm with an imaging data matrix of 400 x 256 x 256. This produced a 50 &#956;m isotropic image for the prescribed FOV. The k-space image data were processed by zero-filling to an 800 x 512 x 512 matrix before trapezoid k-space filtration, cutoff (0.25, 0.75), and sliding window k-space baseline correction before Fourier transformation to a final image set of 25 &#956;m isotropic digital resolution.</p><p>Paraffin embedding, sectioning, and H&amp;E staining of WT and KO brains were performed by Histoserv, Inc. (Germantown, MD).</p><p>For immunostaining of tissue sections, mice were transcardially perfused via the left ventricle with 50 ml of phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.5, followed by 40 ml of 4% v/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed for an additional 16 h by immersion in 4% PFA at room temperature followed by storage in PBS. Subsequently, the brains were transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) overnight. Sagittal free-floating sections (35 &#956;m thick) were prepared on a Leica 9000s microtome. For GluA1 (Millipore AB1504) staining, sections were additionally treated for 30 minutes at 85&#176;C in 10 mM sodium-citrate buffer for antigen retrieval before blocking. For &#948;2R (Frontier Inst. 897&#8211;934, RB-Af1200) staining, sections were incubated in 1 mg/ml pepsin (DAKO) in 0.2 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 10 min at 37&#176;C for antigen retrieval. Sections were rinsed in 0.1 M PB and subsequently blocked with 4% normal goat serum in 0.1 M PB containing 0.25% v/v Triton X-100 (blocking solution) at room temperature for 2 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and the sections were incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with gentle agitation. After washing 3 times with wash buffer (0.1 M PB containing 0.25% Triton X-100), sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor 488 and 594) diluted in wash buffer. After an additional three washes with wash buffer, sections were mounted on coverslips with MOWIOL/DABCO containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

In brief, after decapitation, the cortex from E18.5 mice was dissected and treated with 0.25% trypsin (Corning) and 100 &#956;g/ml DNAse in 2.2 mM EDTA for 15 min. The tissue was then disrupted by pipetting up and down 10 times with 10 ml and 5 ml pipets. The cells were filtered through a 70 &#956;m cell strainer and centrifuged for 5 min at 900 x g. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml plating medium consisting of Dulbecco&#8217;s Modified Eagle Medium (<sc>D</sc>MEM) (with 4.5 g/l glucose, 25 mM HEPES, without phenol red) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#956;g/mL streptomycin. 80,000 cells per well were plated on 12-well plates previously coated with polylysine and laminin.
