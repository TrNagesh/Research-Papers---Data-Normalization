<p>All animal care and experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines provided by the German Animal Welfare Act (German Ministry of Agriculture, Health and Economic Cooperation). Animal housing and breeding at the University of W&#252;rzburg was approved by the regulatory agency of the city of W&#252;rzburg (Reference ABD/OA/Tr; according to &#167;11/1 No. 1 of the German Animal Welfare Act). All aspects of the mouse work were carried out following strict guidelines to ensure careful, consistent and ethical handling of mice.</p><p>Tissues used in this study were derived from wildtype, heterozygous and knockout littermates of either of the two currently existing SUN1 deficient mouse strains, <italic>Sun1<sup>(&#916;ex10-13)</sup></italic> and <italic>Sun1<sup>(&#916;ex10-11)</sup></italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Ding1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Chi1">[21]</xref>. For immunofluorescence studies testes and ovaries from wildtype, heterozygous and SUN1 knockout progeny of the <italic>Sun1<sup>(&#916;ex10-11)</sup></italic> strain were fixed for 3 hrs in 1% PBS-buffered formaldehyde (pH 7.4). Tissues were then dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series, infiltrated with paraffin wax at 58&#176;C overnight and embedded in fresh paraffin wax as described in Link et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Link1">[13]</xref>. For EM analysis we prepared tissue material from wildtype, heterozygous and SUN1 deficient mice from both SUN1 deficient mouse strains, the <italic>Sun1<sup>(&#916;ex10-13)</sup></italic> and <italic>Sun1<sup>(&#916;ex10-11)</sup></italic> strain, according to the protocol described below.</p><p>For the generation of SUN2 specific antibodies, a His-tagged SUN2 fusion construct (amino acids 248&#8211;469 of the SUN2 protein) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> RosettaBlue (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and purified through Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen, D&#252;sseldorf, Germany). This peptide was used for immunization of a guinea pig (Seqlab, G&#246;ttingen, Germany). The serum obtained was affinity purified against the SUN2 antigen coupled to a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Similarly, for the generation of a KASH5 specific antibody, a His-tagged KASH5-fusion construct (amino acids 421&#8211;612) was expressed and purified as described above. This peptide was used for immunization of a rabbit and the serum obtained was purified using a KASH5 antigen coupled HiTrap NHS-activated HP column. Further primary antibodies used in this study were: goat anti-Lamin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), rabbit anti-SYCP3 antibody (anti-Scp3; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), guinea pig anti-SUN1 antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Gb1">[27]</xref> and mouse anti-KASH5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Morimoto1">[23]</xref>. For TeloFISH analyses we further used monoclonal mouse anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Corresponding secondary antibodies used for this study were: Cy2 anti-mouse, texas red anti-mouse, alexa647 anti-rabbit, texas red anti-rabbit, Cy2 anti-guinea pig and texas red anti-goat; all obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany) and used as suggested by the manufacturer.</p><p>Double-label immunofluorescence analyses were carried out on paraffin sections of testis or ovary tissue (3&#8211;7 &#181;m) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Link1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Gb1">[27]</xref>. Paraffin sections were prepared for immunofluorescence by first removing the paraffin by two consecutive incubations of 10 min each in Roti-Histol (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Then the tissue sections were rehydrated in a decreasing ethanol series. Subsequently, antigen retrieval was conducted by incubating the slides in antigen unmasking solution (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 125&#176;C and 1.5 bar for 7&#8211;20 min. After permeabilization of the tissue in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and washing in PBS, slides were blocked for 30 min in blocking solution (5% milk, 5% FCS, 1 mM PMSF; pH 7.4 in PBS). After incubation with the first primary antibody either for 2 hrs at room temperature or overnight at 4&#176;C, slides were washed in PBS and again blocked in blocking solution before incubating the samples with the second primary antibody for another 2 hrs at room temperature. Following two washing steps (10 min each) in PBS and reblocking for 30 min in blocking solution slides were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies. DNA was counterstained using Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany).</p><p>To label telomeres and selected proteins simultaneously, we combined telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (TeloFISH) with immunofluorescence protocols on paraffin sections as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Link1">[13]</xref>. Paraffin sections were rehydrated and antigen retrieval was conducted as described above. Prior to TeloFISH, cells were permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After rinsing in 2&#215; SSC (0.3M NaCl, 0.03M Na-citrate; pH 7.4) cells were denatured at 95&#176;C for 20 min in 40 &#181;l of hybridization solution (30% formamide, 10% dextrane sulphate, 250 &#181;g/ml <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA in 2&#215; SSC) supplemented with 10 pmol digoxigenin-labeled (<named-content content-type="gene">TTAGGG</named-content>)<sub>7</sub>/(<named-content content-type="gene">CCCTAA</named-content>)<sub>7</sub> oligomeres. Hybridization was performed at 37&#176;C overnight in a humid chamber. Slides were washed two times in 2&#215; SSC at 37&#176;C for 10 min each and blocked with 0.5% blocking-reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in TBS (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl; pH 7.4). Samples were incubated with mouse anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol and bound antibodies detected with Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Following the TeloFISH procedure, samples were prepared for immunofluorescence by blocking with PBT (0.15% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4). Slides were incubated with the first primary antibody overnight, washed two times in PBS for 10 min each and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody as described above. Finally, slides were again washed in PBS before incubating with the second primary antibody. After repeated washing in PBS samples once again were exposed to the corresponding secondary antibodies. DNA was counterstained using Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany).</p><p>For electron microscopy, fresh tissue from testis and ovary was prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004099-Schmitt1">[22]</xref>. The tissues were fixed in 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde solution (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl, 50 mM cacodylate; pH 7.2) for 45 min and washed in cacodylate buffer (50 mM cacodylate, pH 7.2). This was followed by incubation in 2% osmium tetroxide in 50 mM cacodylate at 0&#176;C. The samples were then washed several times in water at 4&#176;C and contrasted using 0.5% uranyl acetate in water at 4&#176;C overnight. Subsequently, the tissues were dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series and incubated three times in propylene oxide for 30 min. Finally, the samples were embedded in epon for ultrathin sectioning.</p><p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS-SP2; Leica, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with a 63x/1.40 HCX PL APO lbd.BL oil-immersion objective. Images shown are pseudo colored by the Leica TCS-SP2 confocal software and are calculated maximum projections of sequential single sections. These were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). 3D reconstructions, as well as analysis and quantification of telomere attachment and clustering were conducted using the ImageJ software (version 1.42q; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>).</p>
