<p>Mice were treated in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press; 8th edition). The protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Usage Committee of NCI-Frederick (NIH) (Animal Study Proposal: 11&#8211;069).</p><p>Mice were kept on a mixed background. Crosses were performed as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006018.t001">Table 1</xref>, wherein the female genotype is listed on the left side of the cross and male genotype on the right. Genotyping was performed as previously reported for the following alleles: <italic>Fgf3</italic><sup><italic>&#916;</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref034">34</xref>], <italic>Bak</italic><sup><italic>&#916;</italic></sup><italic>; Bax</italic><sup><italic>&#916;</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref056">56</xref>], <italic>Noggin</italic><sup><italic>Lacz</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref028">28</xref>], <italic>Bmpr1a</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref119">119</xref>] <italic>Bmpr1b</italic><sup><italic>&#916;</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref078">78</xref>], <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>MTMG</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref120">120</xref>]. One exception is that we used the following primers to detect the <italic>Bax</italic>
<sup><italic>&#916;</italic></sup> allele: (5&#8217;- CAA CTC CTA CCG CAA GTC CTG G-3&#8217; and 5&#8217;- GAA CCC TAG GAC CCC TCC G-3&#8217;). All <italic>Fgf3</italic><sup><italic>&#916;/&#916;</italic></sup><italic>; BmpR1b</italic><sup><italic>&#916;/&#916;</italic></sup> and littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006018.g008">Fig 8</xref>) also carried <italic>BmpR1a</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup>, which, if unrecombined, has wildtype activity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref119">119</xref>] and <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>MTMG/MTMG</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref120">120</xref>]. Neither these progeny nor their parents contain a Cre transgene or allele and therefore these alleles had no phenotypic consequence.</p><p>Whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref031">31</xref>]. In all cases, control and experimental embryos were processed in the same tubes throughout the procedure. The <italic>Fgf8intron</italic> probe was constructed using the primers: 5&#8217;-GGAATTC ACGCAGTCCTTGCCTTTGCCG-3&#8217; and 5&#8217;- GGAATTCATCTGCATGAACAAGAAGG-3&#8217;, to amplify an ~700bp product from intron 5 of the <italic>Fgf8</italic> gene. For sectioning, embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS then dehydrated into 100% methanol. Embryos were then embedded using the JB-4 Embedding kit as per kit protocol (Polysciences, Inc; Catalog #00226). Blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 6&#956;M and counterstained with a neutral red stain. Skeletal preparations were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref121">121</xref>]. LysoTracker Red staining was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref122">122</xref>].</p><p>For immunostaining on sections, embryos were embedded in paraffin and 7&#956;M sections were cut. After dewaxing and rehydration, antigen retrieval was achieved by incubating slides in 0.01M Sodium Citrate pH 6.0 at 95&#176;C (20 min). Each slide was incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4&#176;C and in secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature and then counterstained with DAPI (ThermoFisher, D21490). Primary antibodies: Cleaved Caspase-3 (1:100, Cell Signaling, #9661); Phospho-Histone H3 (1:200, Cell Signaling, #9706). Secondary antibodies: anti-Mouse-488 (1:250, ThermoFisher, A-11017); anti-Rabbit-594 (1:250, ThermoFisher, A11012). All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (1% Goat serum in PBS). Confocal images were taken and Z-stacks were constructed using imageJ software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref123">123</xref>].</p><p>Phosphohistone H3 positive and negative nuclei were counted from 3 sections from each of 3 embryos for each genotype and averaged. Percentages represent number of positive nuclei divided by total nuclei.</p><p>Whole mount immunostaining (Neurofilament1) was performed on embryos fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4&#176;C, then dehydrated stepwise into methanol and stored at -20&#176;C. Embryos were bleached in Methanol: 30% Hydrogen Peroxide (5:1), rehydrated and blocked in PBSMT (2% dried milk, 0.1% Triton x-100 in PBS) for 2 hours at room temperature. Primary antibody (1:100, DSHB, 2H3 Concentrate) was diluted in PBSMT and incubated overnight at 4&#176;C. Embryos were then washed 6 x 1 hour and incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with secondary anti-mouse antibody-488 (1:250, ThermoFisher, A-11017). Embryos were washed and cleared in 50% glycerol before imaging.</p><p>The neural tubes were cleanly microdissected with one cut at the anterior side of the last formed somite and the posterior cut between the neural tube and posterior mesoderm. Dissected tissue were placed in 25&#956;L of Trizol and stored at -80&#176;C. Following genotyping, cDNA was synthesized (iScript synthesis kit, BioRad, #1708891) from mRNA extracted from 3&#8211;4 neural tubes. Sybr green reagent with the following primers were used for qPCR: Bmp4 (ACCAATGGAGCCATTCCGTA, ACGACCATCAGCATTCGGTT), Bmp7 (CTACATGAACGCCACCAACC, CACAGCAGGGCTTGGGTAC), Msx1 (CCGTGGATGCAGAGTCCC, GCTTGCGGTTGGTCTTGTGC), GapDH (TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA, AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG). Relative quantification was determined using the delta-delta-CT method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref124">124</xref>].</p><p>Using the measuring tool within Photoshop, linear measurements were made on images of embryos that were taken at the same magnification; units are in pixels. For all data provided, at least an n = 3 was used unless otherwise noted. Significance was determined using a two-tailed t-test unless otherwise noted in the figure legend.</p><p>For determination of NT closure, India ink was diluted 1:10 in PBS and injected into the NT at the anterior boundary of the hindlimb buds using a pulled glass capillary needle. The posterior neuropore was scored as open if the ink passed through the pore; otherwise it was scored as closed.</p><p>Recombinant mouse BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems, 5020-BP-010) was reconstituted in sterile 4mM HCl with 0.1% BSA to 100ug/mL as recommended by manufacturer. Affi-Gel Blue Gel beads (50-100mesh, Bio-Rad;153&#8211;7301) were briefly washed with PBS, then soaked in reconstituted BMP4 solution for 1hr at 37&#176;C, then cooled and stored at 4&#176;C and used in experiments for up to 2 weeks. Embryos were harvested from wildtype (NIH-Swiss) animals on the morning of E10.5 in 37&#176;C PBS. Using forceps, the embryos were cut in half at the interlimb region and the rostral halves were discarded. A small puncture was made with forceps in the dorsal NT at the anterior boundary of the PSM and a bead was inserted into the lumen of the NT and pushed posteriorly towards the PSM. Tissues were transferred to a well of a 24-well plate and cultured at 37&#176;C 5%CO<sub>2</sub> in 250&#956;L of defined media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006018.ref125">125</xref>]: 0.5mL Penicillin-streptomycin (10,000U/mL; Gibco, 15140&#8211;122), 1mL non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 11140&#8211;035), 1mL sodium pyruvate (Sigma, S8636), 2mL D-glucose (22.5%), 0.1mL sodium L-ascorbate (0.2g/mL, Sigma, A4034), 1mL calcium lactate hydrate (40mg/mL, Sigma, L4388), 0.1mL D-biotin (0.2mg/mL, Sigma, 47868), vitamin B12 (40&#956;g/mL, Sigma, V6629), 0.1mL PABA (2mg/mL, Sigma, A9878), to 100mL Dulbecco&#8217;s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco, 11995). Following incubation, samples where briefly rinsed with PBS before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight rocking at 4&#176;C. Samples were then dehydrated into 100% methanol and stored at -20&#176;C until processed for WISH.</p><p>For folic acid supplementation, pregnant mothers carrying <italic>Fgf3</italic> heterozygous and null embryos were intraperitoneally injected with 25mg/kg FA at E7.75 and allowed to develop to E9.5.</p>
