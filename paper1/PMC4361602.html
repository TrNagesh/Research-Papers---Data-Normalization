At intervals, aliquots of cells were removed and serially diluted into aerobic medium. The diluted samples were transferred into the anaerobic chamber, mixed with anaerobic top agar, and poured onto anaerobic medium agar plates. Colonies were counted after 48 hours of anaerobic incubation at 37&#176;C.</p><p>All enzyme assays were performed at room temperature.

<bold>&#223;-galactosidase activity</bold>. To prepare extracts, cells were centrifuged, washed twice, resuspended in 1/30 the original culture volume with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), and lysed by French press.

The SOD activity was measured in cell extracts using the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome <italic>c</italic> method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref070">70</xref>]. After the initial assay, extracts were subjected to partial denaturation and renaturation in the presence of manganese to achieve full activation of MnSOD protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref071">71</xref>]. Briefly, MnSOD was denatured at pH 3.8 by dialysis against cold 5 mM Tris-HCl/2.5 M guanidinium chloride/20 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulphonic acid/0.1 mM EDTA for approximately 12 hr in the dark. The inactive apoenzyme was then renatured by dialysis against cold 5 mM HEPES/0.1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.8) for two periods of approximately 12 hr each. Finally, excess metal was removed by dialysis at pH 7.8 against cold 5 mM Tris-HCl/0.1 mM EDTA for two periods of 4 hr each. The entire reconstitution process was performed at 4&#176;C. The &#8220;% active MnSOD&#8221; reports the initial activity divided by the reconstituted activity.

<bold>Hydroperoxidase I (KatG) activity</bold>. To prepare extracts, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), resuspended in 1/30 the original culture volume, and lysed by French press in ice-cold 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and HPI, the KatG catalase, was specifically assayed through its ability to act as a peroxidase. Extracts were added to 300 &#956;M <italic>o</italic>-dianisidine and 900 &#956;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 10 mM KPi (pH 6.4), and the oxidation of <italic>o</italic>-dianisidine was monitored at A<sub>460</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref072">72</xref>].</p><p>
<bold>NADH dehydrogenase I (Ndh1) activity</bold>. Cells were centrifuged and washed twice with ice-cold 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0). This pH protects the enzyme, which is unstable at higher pH. Final resuspension was in the same buffer at 1/60 the original culture volume. Cells were lysed by French press, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Inverted membrane vesicles were separated from the supernatant by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 2 hr at 4&#176;C. The vesicles were then resuspended in ice-cold 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) at 1/120 the original culture volume. Vesicles were assayed immediately for NADH dehydrogenase activity at A<sub>340</sub> with either 120 &#956;M NADH or 60 &#956;M deamino-NADH as the substrate in the same room-temperature buffer. Ndh2 can use only NADH as a substrate, while Ndh1 can use both deamino-NADH and NADH with equal efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref074">74</xref>].</p><p>
<bold>NADH dehydrogenase II (Ndh2) activity</bold>. Inverted membrane vesicles were isolated as described above. Resuspended inverted vesicles were diluted 5-fold into ice-cold 50 mM KPi (pH 7.8) and held at 0&#176;C overnight to eliminate Ndh1 activity, which is unstable at this pH. The inverted vesicles were incubated in room temperature 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6) containing 3 mM KCN to block respiration through inhibition of cytochrome oxidase; the membranes were then assayed for Ndh2 activity by monitoring NADH oxidation at A<sub>340</sub> in the presence of 200 &#956;M K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, which acts as an oxidant that directly remove electrons from Ndh2.</p><p>Wild-type cells grown in LB medium contain ~ 12 U/mg total SOD activity, of which about one-third is conferred by MnSOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref075">75</xref>]. Since the total cytoplasmic protein concentration is 300 mg/ml, the cytoplasmic MnSOD activity is 1200 U/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref076">76</xref>]. Fully Mn-loaded MnSOD exhibits a specific activity of 7300 U/mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004977.ref077">77</xref>], indicating that the concentration of Mn-loaded protein in the cytoplasm is 0.16 mg/ml. Since the subunit molecular weight is 23097 Daltons, this calculation indicates that the concentration of Mn-loaded subunits is ~7 &#956;M. This compares to the measured total Mn concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004977.g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) of 5 &#956;M. Some imprecision arises from multiple measurements to contribute to this calculation, but the implication is that under this growth condition most cytoplasmic Mn exists within MnSOD protein.

Briefly, cells were centrifuged and resuspended at 1/100 the original culture volume in 37&#176;C LB containing 10 mM DTPA (pH 7.0) to block further iron import and 20 mM DFO (pH 8.0) to facilitate the oxidation of intracellular unincorporated ferrous iron to EPR-detectable ferric iron. The cell mixture was incubated aerobically with vigorous shaking at 37&#176;C for 15 min and then centrifuged. Cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl/10% glycerol (pH 7.4) and finally resuspended in 150 &#956;l of the same buffer. The final optical density was recorded after dilution of an aliquot, and samples were loaded into a quartz EPR tube. Samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80&#176;C for no longer than one week. EPR standards consisted of FeCl<sub>3</sub> dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl/10% glycerol/1 mM DFO (pH 7.4); the iron concentration in the standard was determined using &#8364;<sub>mM</sub> at 420 nM of 2.865 cm<sup>-1</sup>.
