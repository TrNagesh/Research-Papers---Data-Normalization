<p>VAT and SAT were measured on CT following protocols established by each study as detailed in the Study-Specific Methods. We created sex-specific residuals adjusting for age, age-squared, smoking and principal components derived from genotypes denoting population stratification. The following traits were created in the overall sample and in women and men separately for each participating study: VAT, SAT, VAT-adjusted-for-BMI, and VAT/SAT ratio. VAT-adjusted-for-BMI provides insight into the relative amount of VAT controlling for the degree of generalized adiposity, whereas the VAT/SAT ratio is a metric of the propensity to deposit fat viscerally as compared to subcutaneously. The VAT/SAT ratio has been previously shown to be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002695-Kim1">[47]</xref>.

A single axial scan (140 kVp, 300 to 360 mAs, 10-mm thickness) was taken at the disk space between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.

However, among those individuals with CT, only 3,664 had genotyping at the Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Intramural Research Program, NIA, Bethesda, Maryland, and 3,219 participants passed QC criteria for genotyping.
