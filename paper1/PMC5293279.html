<p>All mice were handled in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health under the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases approved animal study protocols. A summary of the transgenic mice used in these investigations is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006580.s005">S2 Table</xref>.</p><p>To construct the transgene, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA (Life Technologies) that included mouse <italic>Astl</italic> (BMQ56H22) was transformed into SW102 bacterial cells containing the &#955; prophage recombineering system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006580.ref044">44</xref>]. A PCR fragment (1331 bp) containing the galK operon flanked by 50 bp homologous to the <italic>Astl</italic> gene that would insert the galK gene at the stop codon in the 3&#8217; region of the gene was amplified using Long Amp Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). After digestion with DpnI and overnight gel purification (0.7% agarose, 15 V, 16 hr), the PCR fragment was electroporated into SW102 cells containing the BAC, and recombinants were selected by growth on minimal media with galactose. Using a clone from this first step, the galK cassette was replaced by recombineering with a second PCR fragment (880 bp) encoding mCherry with 50 bp homology arms. Clones were selected on minimal media with 2-deoxy-galactose and confirmed by DNA sequence. Finally, a NotI fragment containing the <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>mCherry</italic></sup> transgene was retrieved from the BAC with pl253, and the fidelity of coding regions was confirmed by DNA sequence.</p><p>After gel purification, the <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>mCherry</italic></sup> transgene was injected into the male pronucleus of &gt;200 one-cell zygotes which were transferred to pseudopregnant female mice. Offspring were genotyped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006580.s001">S1b Fig</xref>) using tail DNA and <italic>Astl</italic> exon 9 oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006580.s006">S3 Table</xref>) that distinguished between the normal allele (268 bp) and the <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>mCherry</italic></sup> transgene (967 bp). From 30 pups, 6 founders were identified that passed the transgene through the germline. Three lines were maintained and the analysis of FVB/N-Tg(Astl-mCherry)1Dean is described herein. Tissue-specific expression of <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>mCherry</italic></sup> was determined by RT-PCR using total RNA from various tissues to make cDNA with SuperScript<sup>&#174;</sup> III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies). PCR analysis of cDNA was performed using primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006580.s006">S3 Table</xref>) designed to span an exon-intron boundary.</p><p>pMLM3613 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA #42251) expressing Cas9 was linearized by PmeI (New England Biolabs), purified with a PCR clean-up kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed with mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 ULTRA (Life Technologies-Ambion, Carlsbad, CA). Double-stranded synthetic DNA targeting exon 2 of <italic>Astl</italic> (5&#8217;-GGACATCCCCGCAATTAACCAAGG-3&#8217;) was cloned into the pair of BsaI sites of pDR274 (Addgene, #42250) expressing sgRNA. After linearization by digestion with DraI, the plasmid was purified with the PCR clean-up kit and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed using MEGAshortscript T7 (Life Technologies-Ambion). After transcription, the Cas9 cRNA and the sgRNA were purified with MEGAclear kit (Life Technologies-Ambion) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instruction and eluted in RNase-free water.</p><p>For zygote injection, B6D2<sub>F1</sub> (C57BL/6 x DBA2) female mice were hormonally stimulated to ovulate (see below) and mated with B6D2<sub>F1</sub> males. One-cell embryos were collected and injected with Cas9 cRNA (50 ng/&#956;l), sgRNA (20 ng/&#956;l) and donor oligo (20 ng/&#956;l). The injected embryos were cultured in KSOM (Zenith Biotech, Guilford, CT) until the blastocyst stage and transferred into pseudopregnant CD1 female mice. The sequence of injected oligonucleotide was: 5&#8217;-TCTGGAGTCTGCAGTACCAGTGTTCCAGAAGGCTTCACTCCTGAGGGAAGCCCGGTATTTCAGAACCAAGGTGAGAACACGGGGCCACACTCCAAAGCCATGCTGAATGTGGACATGCGGAAAAGA-3&#8217;. The genotype of the <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>&#916;</italic></sup> allele was initially determined by DNA sequence of tail DNA and subsequently by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer that bridged the deleted sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006580.s006">S3 Table</xref>).</p><p>GV-intact oocytes from 4&#8211;6-wk-old female mice were collected by puncturing ovarian follicles in M2 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 48 hr post-injection of 5 IU of equine gonadotropin hormone (eCG). Ovulated eggs and embryos from 4&#8211;6-wk-old female mice were collected before and after mating, respectively, in M2 medium after injection of 5 IU of eCG followed by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 46&#8211;48 hr later. Embryos were subsequently cultured in KSOM (Zenith Biotech) at 37&#176;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to obtain 1- and 2-cell embryos. To inhibit actin polymerization, the medium was supplemented with 100 &#956;M CK-666 (Sigma-Aldrich), a cell permeable inhibitor of arp2/3. For individual experiments, 20&#8211;30 cells were used from 3 different animals and representative images were included in figures.</p><p>A rabbit polyclonal antibody that binds a C-terminal peptide of ovastacin<sup>395-408</sup> and monoclonal antibody M2c.2 that binds to the C-terminal region of ZP2 have been characterized previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006580.ref032">32</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006580.ref045">45</xref>]. The following antibodies and lectins were obtained commercially: LCA-FITC (Sigma-Aldrich); antibodies to GP73, calregulin and EEA1, Alex Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)(Life Technologies-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies-Invitrogen); DyLight 649 goat anti&#8211;rabbit IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies-Invitrogen); and goat anti-rat IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz).</p><p>pCS2+/UtrCH-EGFP (Addgene, #26737) was linearized with NsiI and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed using SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Life Technologies-Ambion, AM1340). cRNA was purified by MEGAclear (Life Technologies-Ambion). Full-length and truncated ovastacin open reading frames were inserted into the pmCherry-N1 vector (Clontech Laboratories). Capped cRNAs were synthesized from PCR templates using T7 mMessage mMachine (Life Technologies-Ambion), and purified with MEGAclear (Life Technologies-Ambion). Microinjection was performed in M2 medium (Zenith Biotech) using a TransferMan NK2 micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). Typically, 10&#8211;12 pl (4% of the oocyte volume) of 0.5&#8211;1.0 &#956;g/&#956;l cRNA was injected into oocytes. For each cRNA construct, 20&#8211;30 GV-intact oocytes from 3 mice were injected, incubated in M2 media (37&#176;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 6 hr prior to fixation and imaging by confocal microcopy. Variations in the intensity of the mCherry signal were noted among oocytes injected with the same construct and those with the strongest signals were selected for fixation and imaging by confocal microscopy using similar settings.</p><p>GV-intact oocytes, ovulated eggs or embryos (20&#8211;30) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and blocked in SuperBlock (Piercenet, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were incubated with primary antibody (1:100) for 1 hr at room temperature or 4&#176;C overnight. After three washes in 0.3% PVP/PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min each, oocytes or embryos were incubated with secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 hr at room temperature. For LCA staining, eggs or embryos were stained with LCA-FITC (1:100) for 1 hr at room temperature. After three washes in 0.3% PVP/PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min each, samples were mounted in PBS containing Hoechst 33342 (1&#956;g/ml). Confocal laser-scanning images were obtained using similar settings within experiments on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany), with a 63 x 1/2 W objective and exported as full-resolution TIF files and processed in Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) to adjust brightness and contrast.</p><p>Time-lapse imaging was obtained with the LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat 40&#215;, 1.2 NA water immersion objective. mCherry was excited with a 561-nm laser line and detected with a 575&#8211;615-nm band pass. Ovulated eggs (10&#8211;20 from 3 animals) were collected, followed by removal of zonae pellucidae (see below), and placed in HTF medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies-Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) on a gridded cover glass bottom dish (MatTek, Ashland, MA Cat. No. P35G-1.5-7-C-grid). The dish was placed in a humidified chamber (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37&#176;C) attached to the microscope and inseminated with 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> ml<sup>-1</sup> capacitated sperm.</p><p>GV-intact oocytes, ovulated eggs and two-cell embryos (10&#8211;15) were lysed in 4x LDS (lithium dodecyl sulfate) sample buffer with 10x reducing reagent (Life Technologies-Invitrogen), separated on 12% Bis-Tris precast gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Life Technologies-Invitrogen), blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS (Tris buffered saline, pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hr at room temperature, and then probed with 1:500&#8211;1:1,000 dilution of primary antibodies at 4&#176;C overnight. On the following day, blots were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (horse radish peroxidase). Chemiluminescence was performed with ECL Plus (Piercenet) and signals were acquired by a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Valhalla, NY) or with BioMax XAR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).</p><p>Caudal epididymal sperm were isolated from wild-type ICR mice and placed under oil (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) in human tubal fluid (HTF) medium (Zenith Biotech) previously equilibrated with 90% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and capacitated by an additional 1 hr of incubation at 37&#176;C. Sperm binding to ovulated eggs or two-cell embryos isolated from wild-type, <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>Null</italic></sup>, <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>Rescue</italic></sup>, <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>+/&#916;</italic></sup> and <italic>Astl</italic><sup><italic>&#916;/&#916;</italic></sup> mice was observed using capacitated sperm and wild-type 2-cell embryos as a negative wash control. Samples were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min, stained with Hoechst 33342. Bound sperm were quantified from z projections acquired by confocal microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006580.ref046">46</xref>], and results reflect the mean &#177; s.e.m. from at least three independently obtained samples, each containing 6&#8211;12 mouse eggs/embryos. Statistical differences were determined by the 2-tailed Student&#8217;s T-test.</p><p>The zona pellucida of eggs was removed after 5 min incubation in 100 &#956;l of acid Tyrode's solution (Sigma) and then washed 3 times in fresh M2 medium. Cauda epididymides were lanced in a dish of HTF to release sperm that were capacitated for 1 hr (37&#176;C with 90% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and added to zona-intact or zona-free eggs (30 from 3 different animals) at a concentration of 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> ml<sup>-1</sup> sperm in 100 &#956;l HTF for 5 hr at 37&#176;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The presence of two pronuclei was scored as successful fertilization. Statistical differences were determined by the 2-tailed Student&#8217;s T-test.</p>
