<p>For each condition studied, RNA was extracted from approximately 100 &#181;l of packed mixed-stage worms that were collected in M9 at the indicated time point. To induce UPR-associated gene expression, at day three of adulthood worms were treated with 5 &#181;g/ml TM (Sigma) for 16 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-Harding1">[15]</xref>, or at day four with 5 mM DTT (Sigma) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-HenisKorenblit1">[54]</xref> for two hours, 5 &#181;M thapsigargin (Enzo) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-Sasagawa1">[56]</xref> for two hours, or 5 &#181;M Bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor, LC Labs) for six hours (similar to published <italic>C. elegans</italic> MG132 proteasome inhibitor treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-Orsborn1">[57]</xref>). In each case, these treatments were non-lethal. For arsenite (AS) and tBOOH exposure, up to 100 &#181;l of packed worms were collected and nutated in 5 mM AS or 12 mM tBOOH for 1 hour (a non-lethal duration). Each of these treatments was performed in a volume of 1 ml, and was followed by pelleting. RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR as described, with values normalized to an internal standard curve for each amplicon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-RobidaStubbs1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-GloverCutter1">[44]</xref>. The same treatment conditions were used for ChIP experiments.</p><p>Expression or nuclear accumulation of transgenic GFP proteins was scored as &#8220;low,&#8221; &#8220;medium,&#8221; or &#8220;high&#8221; essentially as published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-RobidaStubbs1">[19]</xref>, or were quantified using ImageJ 1.45S.</p><p>ChIP was performed essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-RobidaStubbs1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-GloverCutter1">[44]</xref>. 2 ml of packed mixed-stage worms were crosslinked with formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 minutes. After quenching, lysis, and determination of protein concentration, 1 mg/ml samples were frozen as aliquots at &#8722;80&#176;C. The resolution of the assay was approximately 250&#8211;500 bp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-GloverCutter1">[44]</xref>. The monoclonal antibody FC4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-Bowerman1">[58]</xref> was used for SKN-1 ChIP experiments, as in previous ChIP analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-RobidaStubbs1">[19]</xref>. Other antibodies are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Analyses of intergenic regions and control genes (not shown) indicated that average signals of 14%, 11%, 26%, 4%, 11%, 7%, and 8% represent thresholds for specific presence of SKN-1, Pol II, PSer2, and H3-AcK56, XBP-1, ATF-6, and Histone H3 respectively.</p><p>Worms from five confluent 20 cm<sup>2</sup> plates were collected in M9 with or without TM treatment (5 &#181;g/ml) for 16 hours, in order to generate 2&#215; 1 ml of packed mixed-stage animals. Worms were sonicated 3&#215; for 20 seconds in homogenization buffer (supplied by IMGENEX kit, supplemented with HDAC inhibitors, protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, and MG132) with the Branson midiprobe 4900 Sonifer before fractionation with the IMGENEX Endoplasmic Reticulum Enrichment Kit (Cat No. 10088K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-Ohta1">[59]</xref>. Mitochondrial and ER fractions were washed 3&#215; with 1 ml PBS and resuspended in 400 &#181;l PBS (supplemented with HDAC, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors and MG132). Up to 100 &#181;l of the ER or cytoplasmic fractions were used for each IP.</p><p>Controls for a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against SKN-1c (JDC7, referred to as pSKN-1) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003701.s004">Figures S4F&#8211;S4J</xref>.

Note that both BiP antibodies recognized the same 75 kD band. ATF-6 (Abcam ab11909), Tubulin (Sigma #9026), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz sc25778) antibodies were also used. Phosphorylated p38 was detected using an antibody from Cell Signaling T180/Y182 as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003701-Li1">[23]</xref>. For Western blotting, antibodies were used at the following dilution: 1&#8758;200 FC4 monoclonal &#945;SKN-1, 1&#8758;200 polyclonal &#945;SKN-1, 1&#8758;1000 &#945;Pol II, and 1&#8758;1000 for &#945;Hsc3. All other antibodies were used at manufacturer's recommended concentrations.</p><p>For IPs, the indicated antibodies (50 &#181;l FC4 monoclonal &#945;SKN-1 or polyclonal &#945;SKN-1,10 &#181;l Hsc3 (BiP) or 20 &#181;l BiP (Sigma)) and pre-blocked Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A beads (Zymed) were added to lysates or samples from the fractionation described above. The final volume was brought to 500 &#181;l in 1&#215; PIC, 1&#215; PMSF, and 1&#8758;1000 MG132 diluted in 1&#215; PBS. Samples were nutated overnight at 4&#176;C and washed three times for 5 minutes at 4&#176;C the next day with NP-40 wash buffer. Beads were spun down at 3000 rpm and resuspended in 4&#215; SDS Laemmli Buffer. Samples were boiled for 15 minutes with 20 &#181;l &#946;-mercaptoethanol and 50 &#181;l 4&#215; SDS Laemmli. Samples were loaded (50 &#181;l each) onto NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris 10% Gels.
