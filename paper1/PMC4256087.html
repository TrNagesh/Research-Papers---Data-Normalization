Staged embryos were plated, grown at 16&#176;C for 8&#8211;9 days, and then a mixed population of 1<sup>st</sup> generation gravid adults with 2<sup>nd</sup> generation L2&#8211;L3 animals were harvested by washing with M9 buffer into 96 well plates and frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C, for subsequent immunoblot analysis. Each RNAi treated population was evaluated semi-quantitatively for reduction in phospho-TDP-43 relative to control treated animals. Positives candidates were retested for effects on TDP-43 phosphorylation by independent RNAi treatment and immunoblot, and the RNAi gene target for each plasmid was confirmed by sequencing.</p><p>Equivalent mixed-stage worm lysate fractions were loaded and resolved on precast 4&#8211;15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). On immunoblots, human TDP-43 was detected with a commercially available monoclonal antibody ab57105 (Abcam) directed against human TDP-43 amino acids 1&#8211;261.

Cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding TTBK2-GFP with GenePorter 2 (Genlantis) using the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed for imaging in 4% formaldehyde 96 hours after transfection. Cells were washed 3&#215;5 min in PBS/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>, then blocked in antibody buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% NaN<sub>2</sub>)+10% normal goat serum. Primary antibody was applied and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (Cosmo Bio; 1&#8758;1000). Cells were washed 3&#215;5 min in PBS/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>, then re-blocked for 10 min.

Tissue used for these studies was obtained from the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank (Seattle, WA), and the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center brain bank(Indianapolis, IN), where consent for autopsy and permission for use of tissue in scientific experiments was obtained. FTLD and ALS cases were selected on the basis of having an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of FTLD and FTLD-related disorders or ALS. Control samples were from de-identified neurologically healthy control participants, who were of a similar age.</p><p>Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were anti-TTBK1 (Abcam, 1&#8758;100), anti-TTBK2 (Abgent, 1&#8758;200), and anti-phospho TDP-43 409/410 (CosmoBio, 1&#8758;1000)). In order to minimize variability, sections from all cases (normal and affected subjects) were stained simultaneously for each antibody. Immunostained sections were analyzed using the computerized image analysis system, MicroComputer Imaging Device (MCID, Imaging Research, St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada). Blinded assessment of optical density measurements were obtained relative to the proportional area for TTBK1 and TTBK2 immunostaining in frontal cortex grey matter (three separate readings per case). Data were averaged and are represented as mean +/&#8722; SEM. A two tailed Student's t-test was used to assess differences in TTBK1 and TTBK2 expression between cases and controls. For double label immunohistochemistry experiments, sections were first immunostained with anti-phospho TDP-43 and reaction product was visualized with nickel enhanced DAB (black). Sections were then immunostained with anti-TTBK1 or TTBK2 and visualized with DAB alone (brown). For double label immunofluorescence experiments, AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and AlexaFluor 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used and autofluoresence was quenched with 0.1% Sudan Black <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004803-Oliveira1">[64]</xref>. To demonstrate specificity of the TTBK antibodies, TTBK1 and TTBK2 were blocked with 50-fold amount of immunizing peptide overnight at 4&#176;C before proceeding with the immunostaining protocol (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004803.s005">S5 Figure</xref>).</p>
