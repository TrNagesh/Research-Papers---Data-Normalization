<p>Plasmids pEGFP-Ataxin3-Q28, pEGFP-Ataxin3-Q84 and pFLAG-Ataxin3-Q80 were kindly provided by Dr. Henry L. Paulson (Addgene plasmids 22122, 22123 and 22129). Expression plasmid ATXN3-Q72 was kindly provided by Dr. Randall Pittman (University of Pennsylvania). The wild-type and mutant <italic>ATXN3</italic> cDNAs were sub-cloned in pAcGFPC1 (Clontech, USA) to construct plasmids pGFP-ATXN3-Q28, pGFP-ATXN3-Q84 and pGFP-ATXN3-Q80 respectively. The plasmids pGFP-ATXN3-Q28, pGFP-ATXN3-Q80 and pGFP-ATXN3-Q84 were digested with AgeI and MluI, and the GFP-ATXN3-Q28, GFP-ATXN3-Q80 and GFP-ATXN3-Q84 fragments were sub-cloned into the Tet-inducible plasmid pTRE-3G (Clontech, USA) using appropriate linkers. The trans-activator plasmid pTet-ON-3G (Clontech, USA) and responder plasmids pTRE-GFP-ATXN3-Q84, GFP-ATXN3-Q80 or pTRE-GFP-ATXN3-Q28 was co-transfected into SH-SY5Y cells, and positive clones were selected with G418. Stable SH-SY5Y clones inducibly expressing GFP-ATXN3-Q84, GFP-ATXN3-Q80 and GFP-ATXN3-Q28 were incubated with medium containing doxycycline (500 ng/ml), and expression of the transgene was assessed by Western blotting using anti-ATXN3 antibody. The <italic>PNKP</italic> cDNA was PCR-amplified from plasmid pWZL-Neo-Myr-Flag-PNKP (kindly provided by Drs. William Hahn and Jean Zhao; Addgene plasmid 20594) and sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1-Hygro (Invitrogen, USA) to construct plasmid pRP-PNKP. The catalase cDNA was PCR-amplified from a cDNA clone with appropriate primers and was sub-cloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1-Hygro to construct plasmid pRP-Catalase. Plasmid pRP-PNKP or pRP-Catalase was transfected into SH-SY5Y stable cell lines encoding inducible ATXN3-Q28 and ATXN3-Q84, and the clones were selected against hygromycin resistance. The effective expression of the exogenous PNKP and catalase in these cells were assessed by Western blot analyses with appropriate antibodies. Anti-PNKP mouse monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from Prof. Michael Weinfeld (University of Alberta, Canada) and anti-catalase antibody (Cat # SC-50508) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA. The <italic>PNKP</italic> cDNA was PCR-amplified from plasmid pWZL-Neo-Myr-Flag-PNKP and the PCR product was sub-cloned into XhoI- and BamHI-digested pmCherryC1 (Clontech, USA) to construct pCherry-PNKP expressing Cherry-tagged PNKP.</p><p>SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM medium containing 15% FBS, and 1% B-27 supplement, and differentiated in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 1% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen, USA) and 20 &#956;M retinoic acid. The SH-SY5Y stable cells encoding inducible GFPC1-ATXN3-Q28, GFPC1-ATXN3-Q72, GFPC1-ATXN3-Q80 and GFPC1-ATXN3-Q84 were differentiated for 7 days and transgene expression in the differentiated cells was induced by adding doxycycline to the medium to a final concentration of 500ng/ml. The <italic>siRNA</italic> duplexes for <italic>PNKP</italic> and control scrambled siRNA duplexes with same base composition were purchased from Sigma, USA, and transfection of the <italic>PNKP-siRNA</italic> duplexes into SH-SY5Y cells or differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were performed using <italic>Lipofectamine RNAi-MAX</italic> reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Plasmids encoding micro-RNA-based <italic>PNKP-shRNAmir</italic> and <italic>control-shRNAmir</italic> were purchased from Thermo Scientific, USA, and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA).</p><p>Human autopsy specimens were obtained from SCA3 patients and control subjects in accordance with local legislation and ethical rules. Control brain samples were collected from age-matched individuals who were deemed free of neurodegenerative disorders. The SCA3 brain tissue samples used for this study were obtained from SCA3 patients who were clinically characterized by cerebellar ataxia, opthalmoplegia, dysarthria and dysphagia. The molecular diagnosis of SCA3 was established by analyzing genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood using a combination of PCR and Southern blotting. The exact lengths of the expanded CAG repeat sequences in ATXN3 gene were established by sequencing the CAG repeat expansion loci of the mutant allele. All brain autopsies were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgery, and stored in a &#8722;80&#176;C freezer until further analysis.</p><p>The MJD transgenic mice used in this study were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004834.ref021">21</xref>]. CMVMJD135 mice express the human ATXN3 carrying 135 glutamines and develop a progressive neurological phenotype with onset at 6 weeks, which includes loss of strength, impairment of motor coordination, loss of balance and altered reflexes. At late stages they show an overall reduction in brain weight, with reduced volume and/or total cell number in pontine nuclei and deep cerebellar nuclei, and intranuclear ATXN3 inclusions in several disease-relevant regions of the brain and spinal cord. Transgenic mice and control non-transgenic littermate mice (n = 4&#8211;5 pools of two animals per genotype) with a mean age of 20 weeks were sacrificed by decapitation, and brain slices were obtained for the macrodissection of the deep cerebellar nuclei using a stereomicroscope (Model SZX7, Olympus America Inc., USA) and frozen at &#8722;80&#186;C. For immunofluorescence assays, transgenic and wild-type littermate mice (mean age: 24 weeks) were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with sterile PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were post-fixed overnight in fixative solution and embedded in paraffin. Slides with 4-&#956;m-thick paraffin sections were processed for immunostaining with anti-PKC&#948;, -ATXN3 and&#8212;PNKP antibodies.</p><p>The SCA3 transgenic mice (CMVMJD135 transgenic mice) were sacrificed and the brain tissues were collected according to the standard approved procedure and national and international guidelines and animal protocols were strictly followed.</p><p>Alkaline comet assays were performed using a Comet Assay Kit (Trevigen, USA). The brain tissue was homogenized in PBS at 4&#176;C and sifted through a 300 &#956;m sieve. Cells were suspended in 85 &#956;L of ice-cold PBS and gently mixed with an equal volume of 1% low-melting agarose. The cell suspension was dropped onto an agarose layer, and incubated in lysis buffer for 1 hour. After lysis, slides were incubated in buffer containing 0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA (pH 13) for 40 min, and electrophoresed for 1 hour. After neutralization, slides were stained and analyzed with a fluorescent microscope. To assess genomic DNA damage after treatment with genotoxic agents, cells were treated with 10 &#956;M hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 20 minutes in serum-free medium, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subjected to comet analysis as described above.</p><p>The antibodies for p53 (Cat # 9282), P-p53-S15 (Cat # 9286), P-p53-S20 (Cat # 9287), P-p53-S46 (Cat # 2521), Chk2 (Cat # 2662), P-Chk2-T68 (Cat # 2661), c-Abl (Cat # 2862), P-cAbl-T735 (Cat # 2864), PKC&#948; (Cat # 2058), P-PKC&#948;-T311 (Cat # 2055), p-53BP1-S1778 (CAT # 2675) and caspase-3 (Cat # 9668) were from Cell Signaling, USA; anti-H2AX (Cat # ab11175) and P-&#947;H2AX-S139 (Cat # ab11174) were from Abcam, USA; anti-ATM (Cat # 1549&#8211;1) and P-ATM-S1981 (Cat # 2152&#8211;1) were from Epitomics, USA; anti-ataxin-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (cat # 13505&#8211;1-AP) was from Protein tech, USA; anti-ataxin-3 mouse monoclonal antibody (Cat # Mab5360) was from Millipore, USA; and anti-polyQ diseases marker antibody, 5TF1&#8211;1C2 (cat # Mab1574) was from Millipore, USA. Cell pellets or mouse brain tissues were homogenized and total protein was isolated using a total protein extraction kit (Millipore, USA). The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated from SH-SY5Y cells expressing ATXN3-Q84 and ATXN3-Q28 using a NE-PER nuclear protein extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). The Western blot analyses were performed according to the standard procedure and each experiment was performed a minimum of 3 times to ensure reproducible and statistically significant results.</p><p>Bi-molecular fluorescence complementation assays were performed as described previously by Shyu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004834.ref019">19</xref>]. Plasmids pBiFC-VN173 (encoding 1 to 172 N-terminal amino acids of modified GFP) and pBIFC-VC155 (encoding 155 to 238 C-terminal amino acids of modified GFP) were kindly provided by Dr. Chang-Deng Hu, Purdue University (Addgene plasmids 22011 and 22010). The ATXN3 cDNA (encoding 28 and 84 glutamines) were cloned in-frame with the C-terminal amino acids of modified GFP in plasmid pBiFC-VC155 and the <italic>PNKP</italic> cDNA was cloned in-frame with the N-terminal amino acids of modified GFP in plasmid pBIFC-VN173. SH-SY5Y cells (2&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells) were grown on chamber slides and transfected after 24 hours of plating. Plasmids pVN173-PNKP and pVC155-ATXN3-Q28 or pVN173-PNKP and pVC155-ATXN3-Q84 were co-transfected into SH-SY5Y cells and reconstitution of green/yellow fluorescence was monitored by fluorescence microscopy to assess bimolecular protein-protein interactions. Transfections of pVC155-ATXN3-Q28, pVC155-ATXN3-Q84 and pVN173-PNKP as single plasmids into SH-SY5Y cells were used as negative controls.</p><p>Expression of ATXN3-Q28 and ATXN3-Q84 in SH-SY5Y cells was induced by incubating the cells with doxycycline (500 ng/ml), and after 48 hours of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes. For the <italic>PNKP</italic> depletion experiment, SH-SY5Y cells were grown on cover slips and transfected with <italic>PNKP-siRNA;</italic> 48 hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. The fixed cells were immunostained with anti-p-53BP1, anti-&#947;H2AX or anti-PKC&#948; antibodies. Frozen brain sections from SCA3 patients and control subjects were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and immunostained with anti-p-53BP1 and &#947;H2AX antibodies. Paraffin-embedded transgenic and control mouse brain sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, washed, and immunostained with anti-p-53BP1, anti-&#947;H2AX, and PKC&#948; antibodies. Slides were washed according to our standard protocol and the nuclei stained with DAPI (Molecular Probe, USA) and photographed under a confocal microscope. TUNEL staining of the SH-SY5Y cells transfected with <italic>PNKP-siRNA</italic> and <italic>control-siRNA</italic> was performed using an <italic>in situ</italic> Apoptosis Detection Kit per the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol (Calbiochem, USA).</p><p>SH-SY5Y cells or differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 5mM of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), the ATM inhibitor Ku55933, p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-&#945; or c-Abl kinase inhibitor STI-571 for 3 hours before the expression of ATXN3-Q28 and ATXN3-Q84. The ATM inhibitor Ku55933 was purchased from EMD Biosciences, USA and Pifithrin-&#945; and STI-571 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA. Drugs were added to the cell culture medium to a final concentration of 1 &#181;M, 2 &#181;M or 5 &#956;M and incubated for 3 hours before transgene induction; fresh medium with drugs was replaced after 12 hours. Cells were harvested at various time points for Western blot analyses and for isolating total RNA and qRT-PCR analyses.</p><p>Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM-510 META confocal microscope with 40X or 60X 1.20 numerical aperture water immersion objective. The images were obtained using two different lines of excitation (488 and 543 nm) by sequential acquisition. After excitation with 488 nm laser line emission was measured with a 505&#8211;530 nm filter and after excitation with 543 laser line emission was measured with a 560&#8211;615 nm filter. All images were collected using 4-frame-Kallman-averaging with a pixel time of 1.26 &#956;s, a pixel size of 110 nm and an optical slice of 1.0 &#956;m. Z-stack acquisition was done at z-steps of 0.8 &#956;m. All orthogonal views were done with LSM 510 software at the Optical Microscopy Core Laboratory of UTMB.</p><p>Caspase-3 activities were measured using a Caspase-3 activity assay kit (BD Biosciences, USA). The Caspase 3 assay kit is based on the hydrolysis of the substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA) by caspase 3, resulting in the release of the p-nitroaniline (pNA) moiety from the substrate, and released p-Nitroaniline (pNA) is detected at 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance of pNA from the sample with the control allowed determination of the fold increase in caspase-3 activity and the relative caspase-3 activities are expressed in arbitrary units. SH-SY5Y cells encoding ATXN3-Q28 and ATXN3-Q84 were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, USA) containing 15% FBS and were cultured on 96 well dishes in DMEM (Invitrogen, USA) containing 15% FBS. Expression of ATXN3-Q28 and ATXN3-Q84 were induced in presence or absence of the drugs Ku55933 (2 &#956;M), Pifithrin-&#945; (10 &#956;M) or STI-571 (5 &#956;M) with doxycycline (500 ng/ml). The cells were harvested 3 days after induction and caspase-3 activities were measured. For measuring caspase-3 activities in the <italic>PNKP</italic> and <italic>control-siRNA</italic>-treated cells, the SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 96-well dishes and transfected with <italic>PNKP-siRNA</italic> or <italic>control-siRNA</italic> in the presence or absence of Ku55933 (2 &#956;M), Pifithrin-&#945; (10 &#956;M) or STI-571 (5 &#956;M). The cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection, and caspase-3 activities were measured.</p><p>Total RNA was extracted from SH-SY5Y cells expressing ATXN3-Q28, ATXN3-Q84, <italic>PNKP-siRNA</italic> and <italic>control-siRNA</italic> using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, USA) and purified using the TURBO DNA-free DNAse Kit (Ambion, USA). Brain tissue (deep cerebellar nuclei) from SCA3 transgenic mouse expressing ATXN3-Q135 was homogenized in trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and RNA was isolated as above. 1&#956;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an RT-PCR kit (Clontech, USA). A cDNA aliquot from each reaction was quantified and 500ng of cDNA from each reaction was used for real-time qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR reactions were repeated three times; primers used for the analyses (BAX: PPH00078B; BBC3: PPH02204C; PMAIP1: PPH02090F; BCL2L11: PPH00893) were purchased from Qiagen, USA, and tested for accuracy, specificity, efficiency and sensitivity by the manufacturer.</p><p>PLA assays were performed by the method we described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004834.ref018">18</xref>]. In brief, SCA3 and normal brain sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Tween-20 and washed with 1X PBS. Brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies for PNKP (mouse monoclonal) and ATXN3 (anti-ATXN3; rabbit polyclonal) or PNKP (mouse monoclonal) and DNA ligase 3 (rabbit polyclonal). These samples were subjected to PLAs using the Duolink PLA kit from O-Link Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and the PLA signals were visualized in a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) at 20&#215; magnification.</p><p>All tabulated data are expressed as mean &#177; SD, except where otherwise indicated. Differences between mean values of two groups were analyzed by Student&#8217;s <italic>t</italic> tests after checking for variance distribution via Levene&#8217;s test. We tested all data for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, followed by two-way ANOVA test to evaluate overall group differences. This was followed by Tukey&#8217;s post-hoc test to determine pair-wise significance if the ANOVA test indicated that a significant difference was present in the data set. In all cases, probability values of 0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant.</p>
