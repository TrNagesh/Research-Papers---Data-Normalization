Donnenberg, is the genetic background for all EPEC mutants described here. Mutants were constructed using a modification of the lambda-red recombination technique and antibiotic resistance cassettes removed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref057">57</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref058">58</xref>]. All <italic>Salmonella</italic> mutations were moved into a clean genetic background by P22 transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref059">59</xref>]. Standard cloning protocols were used to generate complementing plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref060">60</xref>].</p><p>All bacterial cultures were grown at 37&#176;C aerobically with vigorous agitation or standing in an anaerobic chamber with internal atmosphere of 5% H<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 90% N<sub>2</sub> (Bactron I, ShelLab). For anaerobic growth experiments, bacteria were grown overnight aerobically then transferred into the anaerobic chamber and diluted 1:100 into media pre-equilibrated for at least 18 hours. Alternate electron acceptors (Sigma-Aldrich) sodium nitrate, sodium fumarate, sodium thiosulfate, and sodium tetrathionate were added to LB to a final concentration of 40mM. Sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 40 mM served as a negative control. DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to LB to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB or MacConkey (Difco) agar supplemented with the following antibiotics as appropriate: kanamycin (50 mg/L), nalidixic acid (50 mg/L), carbenicillin (100 mg/L), streptomycin (100 mg/L), and chloramphenicol (20 mg/L).</p><p>All experiments were performed on at least three separate occasions. Bacterial generation number was calculated using the following equation: [log<sub>10</sub>(CFU final)&#8212;log<sub>10</sub>(CFU start)]/log<sub>10</sub>(2).</p><p>Ethics Statement: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Texas A&amp;M University and North Carolina State University approved all animal experiments (protocol numbers 2012&#8211;084 and 2011&#8211;167 (TAMU) and 14&#8211;132-B (NCSU)). All experiments that utilized mice were performed using 8&#8211;12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories). For competitive infection experiments, mice were infected by gavage with an equivalent ratio of WT and mutant bacteria. The competitive index was determined by dividing the ratio of WT to mutant bacteria in the selected organ by that ratio in the inoculum. For single infections, mice were infected with either WT or mutant bacteria. The harvested tissue was weighed, homogenized, and CFU was determined per gram of tissue collected.</p><p>
<italic>Salmonella</italic> infections were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref015">15</xref>]. For the murine colitis model, mice were administered 20 mg streptomycin in 75 &#956;L sterile water by gavage. Twenty-four hours after treatment, mice were infected with approximately 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in 100 &#956;L volume by gavage. Feces were collected 24 hours after infection. Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation at 96 hours post-infection and organs harvested, homogenized, serially diluted, and plated on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics for enumeration of CFU. For the murine typhoid model, mice were treated with 75 &#956;L sterile water by gavage. Mice were then infected and euthanized as above.</p><p>EPEC mouse infections were performed essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref061">61</xref>]. Mice were infected with approximately 10<sup>8</sup> CFU in 100 &#956;L volume by gavage. Feces were collected every other day for 9 days. Mice were euthanized 10 days post-infection. The aboral 5 cm of small intestine, the entire cecum, and the entire colon were collected. Intestinal contents were exposed through a longitudinal incision. The intestinal segment was placed into sterile PBS and vigorously agitated to remove intestinal contents. Intestinal tissue was washed in sterile PBS to remove remaining ingesta. Intestinal contents and tissue were homogenized separately, serially diluted, and plated on MacConkey agar and LB agar with appropriate antibiotics to enumerate CFU.</p><p>Samples from mouse ileum, cecum, and transverse colon were collected 96 hours post-infection and fixed in formalin. All tissues were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All histologic analyses were performed by a veterinary pathologist blinded as to infection group. Tissues were scored (0&#8211;4) for each of the following parameters: polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, mononuclear leukocyte infiltration, crypt abscess, submucosal edema, villus blunting, and epithelial damage as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref063">63</xref>].</p><p>msDNA was isolated from aerobic late log phase cultures normalized by OD<sub>600</sub>. Bacteria were lysed as for plasmid isolation (Qiagen Mini-prep) and msDNA isolated from the filtered fraction with subsequent ethanol precipitation. msDNA was visualized using a native polyacrylamide gel with in-gel ethidium bromide staining.</p><p>Cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used within 15 passages. HeLa cells (human cervical adenocarcinoma epithelial, ATCC CCL-2) were grown as recommended by ATCC. HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well approximately 24 h prior to infection.</p><p>Late-log phase cultures were prepared by inoculating 10 ml LB broth with 0.3 ml overnight shaking culture. Flasks were grown at 37&#176;C with agitation for 3 hours. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 90 seconds, resuspended in an equal volume of Hanks&#8217; buffered saline solution (HBSS, Mediatech) and added directly to mammalian cells seeded in 24-well plates for 10 minutes. The multiplicity of infection was approximately 50. Non-internalized bacteria were removed by aspiration. Monolayers were washed three times in HBSS and were then incubated in growth media until 30 min post-infection. Thereafter, gentamicin was added at 50 &#956;g/ml from 30&#8211;90 min p.i. to kill extracellular bacteria and reduced to 10 &#956;g/ml from 90 min post-infection For enumeration of intracellular bacteria, monolayers were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilized in 0.2% sodium deoxycholate and serial dilutions were plated on LB agar.</p><p>Swimming motility was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref064">64</xref>]. Swimming was assayed on plates containing 0.3% Difco Bacto Agar (LB agar base 25g/L). Plates were incubated either in open air or in the anaerobic chamber overnight prior to use for swimming assays. Overnight cultures of bacterial strains were grown at 37&#176;C with agitation and cell numbers normalized by optical density. An aliquot of each normalized culture was transferred into the anaerobic chamber. The WT, &#916;<italic>STM3846</italic>, and &#916;<italic>msd</italic> mutants (3 &#956;l each) were spotted onto the same swimming agar plate and incubated at 37&#176;C aerobically or anaerobically for 5 hours. The diameter of the cell spread was measured and compared with that of the WT on the same plate. Each assay was performed in triplicate on three independent occasions (anaerobic) or in four replicates on two independent occasions (aerobic).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All data were log transformed prior to analysis. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05 and was determined using a t-test or ANOVA where indicated.</p><p>Aerobic overnight cultures of the wild type and the &#916;<italic>STM3846</italic> and &#916;<italic>msd</italic> mutants were diluted 1:100 and incubated either aerobically or in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) for 4 hours on three independent occasions. Bacteria were pelleted and supernatants discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.0 and lysed by vigorous vortexing in the presence of 0.1 mm silica/zirconia beads. Proteins were denatured and reduced with 8M urea and 5 mM dithiothrietol, respectively, for 30 minutes at 60&#176;C. The proteins underwent enzymatic digestion for 3 hours at 37&#176;C with 1/50 enzyme/protein (w/w) ratio of sequencing-grade trypsin. The resultant peptides were desalted for mass spectrometric (MS) analysis using C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (50 mg, 1 mL, Discovery, Supelco). The cartridges were activated with methanol, followed by equilibration with 0.1% TFA before loading the samples. The cartridges were then washed with 5% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA and eluted with 80% ACN/0.1% TFA. Eluted peptides were concentrated in the vacuum centrifuge and diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with water for the MS analysis.</p><p>Digested peptides were loaded into capillary columns (75 &#956;m x 35 cm, Polymicro) packed with C18 beads (3 &#956;m particles, Phenomenex) connected to a custom-made 4-column LC system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref065">65</xref>]. The elution was performed using the following gradient: equilibration in 5% B solvent, 5&#8211;8% B over 2 min, 8&#8211;12% B over 18 min, 12&#8211;35% B over 50 min, 35&#8211;60% min over 27 min and 60&#8211;95% B over 3 min. (solvent A: 0.1% FA; solvent B: 90% ACN/0.1% FA) and flow rate of 300 nL/min. Eluting peptides were directly analyzed either on an Orbitrap (LTQ Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer using chemically etched nanospray emitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref066">66</xref>]. Full scan mass spectra were collected at 400&#8211;2000 m/z range and the ten most intense ions were submitted to low-resolution CID fragmentation once (35% normalized collision energy), before being dynamically excluded for 60 seconds.</p><p>Tandem mass spectra were searched with MSFG+ against <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium 14028s and common contaminant sequences (downloaded from NCBI, all in forward and reversed orientations), using the following parameters: (i) partial tryptic digestion, (ii) 50 ppm parent mass tolerance, (iii) methionine oxidation as a variable modification. The peptides were filtered with a MSGF probability score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref067">67</xref>] &#8804; 1x10<sup>&#8211;9</sup>. Peak areas for each peptide were retrieved using the MultiAlign tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref068">68</xref>], and to ensure the quality of peptide-to-peak matching, the data was filtered with a Statistical Tools for AMT tag Confidence (STAC) score &#8805; 0.7 and uniqueness probability &#8805; 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref069">69</xref>]. Additionally, proteins were required to have at least 2 peptides and at least one peptide with STAC &#8805; 0.9. Peptide abundance values were log transformed and rolled-up into proteins using Qrollup tool, available in DAnTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005472.ref070">70</xref>]. Abundance values for each protein across all 32 conditions (WT, mutants, anaerobic, aerobic conditions, biological replicates, and technical replicates) were used to calculate a Z-score for each measurement where missing values were filled with 19.5. The Z-score transformation enables comparisons of trends across conditions and proteins to identify relevant abundance changes.</p>
