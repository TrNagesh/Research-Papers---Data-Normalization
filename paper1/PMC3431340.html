Prostasin-deficient (<italic>Prss8<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic>) mice were generated by standard blastocyst injection of C57BL/6J-derived embryonic stem cells carrying a gene trap insertion in the <italic>Prss8</italic> gene (clone IST10122F12, Texas A&amp;M Institute for Genomic Research, College Station, TX).</p><p>Breeding females were checked for vaginal plugs in the morning and the day on which the plug was found was defined as the first day of pregnancy (E0.5). Pregnant females were euthanized in the mid-day at designated time points by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation. Embryos were extracted by Caesarian section and the individual embryos and placentae were dissected and processed. Visceral yolk sacs of individual embryos were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline, subjected to genomic DNA extraction and genotyped by PCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002937.s002">Table S1</xref> for primer sequences). Newborn pups were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation at 0&#176;C. For histological analysis, the embryos and newborn pups were fixed for 18&#8211;20 hrs in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, processed into paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), or used for immunohistochemistry as described below. For histomorphometric analysis of placental labyrinth, the midline cross sections of plancetal tissues were stained with H&amp;E and the thickness of the labyrinth was determined as the maximum perpendicular distance of fetal vessel from the chorionic trophoblast layer.</p><p>Antigens from 5 &#181;m paraffin sections were retrieved by incubation for 10 min at 37&#176;C with 10 &#181;g/ml proteinase K (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) for HAI-1 staining, or by incubation for 20 min at 100&#176;C in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for all other antigens. The sections were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with rabbit anti-human CD31 (1&#8758;100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), goat anti-mouse HAI-1 (1&#8758;200, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), mouse anti-human prostasin (1&#8758;200, BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), sheep anti-human matriptase (1&#8758;200, R&amp;D Systems) or ENaC&#947; subunit (1&#8758;100, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) primary antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized using biotin-conjugated anti-mouse, -rabbit, -sheep or -goat secondary antibodies (all 1&#8758;400, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) using 3,3&#8242;-diaminobenzidine as the substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). All microscopic images were acquired on an Olympus BX40 microscope using an Olympus DP70 digital camera system (Olympus, Melville, NY).</p><p>Placentae were extracted from embryos at E10.5 or E11.5. The embryonic portion of each placenta was manually separated from maternal decidua using a dissecting microscope. The tissues were then homogenized in ice-cold 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 1% NP-40; 500 mM NaCl buffer and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4&#176;C to remove the tissue debris and the supernatant was used for further analysis as described below.</p><p>Lysates from two placentae of the same genotype were combined and pre-incubated with 100 ul GammaBind G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 30 minutes at 4&#176;C with gentle agitation. The samples were spun at 5,000 g for 1 min to remove the beads, and the supernatant was then incubated with 5 &#181;g goat anti-mouse HAI-1 antibody (R&amp;D Systems) and 100 ul of GammaBind G Sepharose beads for 3 hours at 4&#176;C. The samples were spun at 5,000 g for 1 min, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml ice-cold 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 1% NP-40; 500 mM NaCl buffer. The beads were then mixed with 30 ul of 1&#215; SDS loading buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 0.25 M &#946;-mercaptoethanol, incubated for 5 min at 99&#176;C, and cooled on ice for 2 minutes. The samples were spun at 5,000 g for 1 min and the released proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4&#8211;12% polyacrylamide gel) and analyzed by western blot using mouse anti-human prostasin (1&#8758;250, BD Transduction Labs) or sheep anti-human matriptase (1&#8758;500, R&amp;D Systems) primary antibodies and goat anti-mouse (DakoCytomation) or donkey anti-sheep (Sigma-Aldrich) secondary antibodies (both 1&#8758;1000) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and visualized using nitro-blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3&#8242;-indolyphosphate.</p><p>Five ug per g of body weight of amiloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10% DMSO in PBS was administered to pregnant females by intraperitoneal injection every 24 hours starting on E5.5. Embryos were extracted on E9.5 by Caesarian section and genotyped as described, and scored for neural tube closure defects.</p><p>The generation of pIRES2-EGFP-prostasin has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002937-NetzelArnett2">[26]</xref>. Substitution of the native prostasin activation site (APQAR) by the enteropeptidase-dependent cleavage site (DDDDK), and either the S238A or V170D point mutations were introduced using the QuickChange Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following primers, respectively: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-GCTCCCTGCGGTGTGGCCCCCCAAGCACGCATCACAGGTGGCAGC-3&#8242;</named-content>, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-GACGCCTGCCAGGGTGACGCTGGGGGCCCACTCTCCTGC-3&#8242;</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#8242;-GGCCTCCACTGCACTGACACTGGCTGGGGTCAT-3&#8242;</named-content>. Successful mutagenesis was verified by sequencing of both strands of the resulting cDNA. Expression plasmids carrying individual mutations were transiently transfected into HEK-293T cells using Turbofect (Fermentas). The cells were grown for two days and soluble recombinant prostasin was prepared by treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002937-NetzelArnett2">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Recombinant wildtype, V170D Frizzy or catalytically inactive S238A prostasin zymogen variants were first incubated with 5.1 U recombinant bovine enteropeptidase (Novagen, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 37&#176;C in enterokinase buffer (Novagen). Following enteropeptidase removal using the Enterokinase Removal Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), the protein concentration was estimated by western blot of serially diluted proteins using a reference with known protein concentration. For substrate hydrolysis assays, the activated prostasin variants (62.5 nM) were incubated with the fluorogenic substrate pERTKR-AMC (50 &#181;M final concentration) (R&amp;D systems) at 37&#176;C in 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 0.01% Tween-20 buffer, and the fluorescence was measured using a Wallac plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Each measurement was performed in triplicate. For serpin complex formation, prostasin variants were diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 to a final concentration of 150 nM, incubated with 250 ng recombinant human protease nexin-1 (PN-1) (R&amp;D Systems) for 1 h at 37&#176;C, and analyzed using 12% reducing SDS-PAGE and western blotting, using a monoclonal anti-prostasin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories).</p><p>HEK 293 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells were co-transfected with pSRE-firefly luciferase (50 ng), pRL-Renilla luciferase (20 ng), pcDNA 3.1 Par2 (100 ng) (Missouri S&amp;T cDNA Resource Center) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen), pcDNA 3.1 expression vectors containing wildtype human matriptase or catalytically dead matriptase (S805A), full length human HAI-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002937-Oberst2">[69]</xref> and empty pcDNA 3.1 vector to equalize the total amount of transfected DNA. After 36 h the cells were serum starved over night and then stimulated with 100 nM recombinant human soluble prostasin (R&amp;D) or vehicle for 6 h. Cell were lysed and luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminiscence was measured using Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) and the SRE activation was determined as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase counts. The assay was performed two times in duplicates.</p>
