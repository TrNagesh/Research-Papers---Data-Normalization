<p>The generation of <italic>Evc2</italic> mutant mice and <italic>Evc2</italic> floxed mice was reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref027">27</xref>]. <italic>Fgf18</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic></sup> mutant mice were reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref040">40</xref>]. <italic>Fgf18</italic><sup><italic>GFP</italic>:<italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice contain a splice acceptor (SA) GFP:CreERT2 insertion into the first intron of <italic>Fgf18</italic> (D.M.O., I.H.H. unpublished). To obtain <italic>Evc2</italic> homozygous mutant embryos, timed mating between two heterozygous <italic>Evc2</italic> germ-line knockout mice was carried out. Noon of the date when the vaginal plug was observed was designated embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). <italic>Evc2</italic> floxed mice were bred with mice carrying doxycycline inducible Aggrecan enhancer-driven, tetracycline-inducible Cre (<italic>ATC</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref043">43</xref>] or <italic>Dermo1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref044">44</xref>] mice to generate conditional deletions of <italic>Evc2</italic>. For chondrocyte-specific deletion mediated by <italic>ATC</italic>, doxycycline-supplemented chow diet (Harlan TD01306) was provided to pregnant females from E9.5. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with University of Michigan guidelines and federal laws covering the humane care and use of animals in research. All animal procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Michigan (Protocol #PRO00005716).</p><p>Limbs were dissected out from embryos, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) according to standard procedures. For skeletal staining, dissected limbs were skinned and stained with alcian blue and alizarin red according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref048">48</xref>]. For immunohistochemistry, limbs were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4&#176;C and cryo-protected in 30% sucrose in PBS solution before embedding in OCT. Specimens were cut into 10-&#956;m sections and incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with antibody against EVC2 (Y20, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), GLI2 (H300, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), SMO (N19, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), SUFU (H300, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), EVC (HPA008703, 1:50, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), KIF7 (Ab95884, 1:100, Cambridge, MA, USA), acetylated tubulin (T6793, 1:1000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), gamma tubulin (T5326, 1:1000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pERK (4695, 1:50, Cell signaling, Danvers, MA 01923), or STAT1 (Ab3987, 1:100, Cambridge, MA, USA). Sections were then incubated with corresponding Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature before mounting with ProLong Gold Anti-fade Reagent with DAPI (P36935, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). All fluorescence images were acquired at room temperature by confocal microscopy (Nikon C1) through Nikon EZ-C1 3.91 and processed by Adobe Photoshop CS6.</p><p>For primary chondrocyte isolation, rib or long bone cartilage was dissected from E18.5 embryos and digested with collagenase A (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Chondrocytes released will be subsequently cultured in DMEM (Life Technology, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA, USA). Experiment will be carried out using cells within 5 passages. For immunocytochemistry, cultured primary chondrocytes were starved in 0.5% serum for 36 h before treatment with 100 nmol of SAG (Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA) for 4 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA and permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) before incubation with primary antibody at 4&#176;C for overnight and with fluorescent secondary antibody. Mounting was done with ProLong Gold Anti-fade Reagent containing DAPI.</p><p>RNA was isolated from primary chondrocytes using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. For RNA isolation from embryonic growth plates, long bones were dissected out at E16.5. Growth plates were collected from tibiae and placed into TRIzol for homogenization according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. For isolation of perichondrium cells, growth plates were dissected out from embryonic tibiae and digested with 1 unit /ml Dispase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref048">48</xref>]. For reverse transcription, 1 &#956;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems ViiA7, with the following taqman probes: Mm00494645_m1 for <italic>Gli1</italic>, Mm99999915_g1 for <italic>Gapdh</italic>, Mm00439612_m1 for <italic>Ihh</italic>, Mm00436026_m1 for <italic>Ptch1</italic>, Mm00436057_m1 for <italic>Pthrp</italic>, Mm00433294_m1 for <italic>Fgfr3</italic>, Mm00438941_m1 for <italic>Fgfr2</italic>, Mm00438932_m1 for <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, Mm00432448_m1 for <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (P21), and Mm00433286_m1 for <italic>Fgf18</italic>.</p><p>Tibiae were dissected out from hindlimbs of E16.5 embryos and placed into 24-well plates with 1 ml medium (alpha MEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.5% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Media were changed every other day, and the full length of tibia was measured at day 1 (D1) and D7. The ratios of the lengths at D7 over the lengths at D1 was calculated and compared between controls and mutants.</p><p>RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref049">49</xref>] using a digoxygenin-labeled <italic>Fgf18</italic> probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006510.ref040">40</xref>]. Briefly, embryonic tissues were immediately fixed in 4% PFA, before cryo-protected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Then, 20 &#956;m sections were treated with proteinase K, post-fixed with 4% PFA, before treated with acetic anhydride solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Sectioned tissues were hybridized with RNA probe in hybridization solution containing 5X SSC, 50% formamide, 1mg/mg tRNA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.1mg/ml Heparin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 65&#176;C. Sectioned tissues were then digested with RNase A (Roche) and washed in post-hybridization washing solution containing 0.2X SSC, before incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugated mouse anti-digoxygenin for overnight. Purple color for positive signal was developed through incubation sections with BM Purple for AP substrate precipitating (Roche).</p>
