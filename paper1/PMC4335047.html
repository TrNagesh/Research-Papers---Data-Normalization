<p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Multiple sequence alignments were generated using MUSCLE at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/</ext-link>. ConSurf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004991.ref044">44</xref>] and PyMOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004991.ref045">45</xref>] were used to obtain sequence conservation scores and project the surface representation of sequence conservation on the crystal structure of the <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> authentic HisRS (PDB:3HRK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004991.g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). To obtain a hypothetical model of the Gcn2 HisRS-uncharged tRNA complex, the co-crystal structure of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> AspRS-tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> complex (PDB: 1ASZ[Ref: PubMed: 8313877]) was aligned with <underline><italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic></underline> HisRS (PDB: 3HRK) by superimposing the highly conserved catalytic core domain (327 residues) using Dali pairwise comparison with default parameters [Ref: PubMed: 19481444]. This alignment produced a robust Z score of 12.9, a RMSD of 3.0 &#197;, and minimal clashes between tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and HisRS. A similar alignment procedure was previously used to model HisRS interaction with tRNA<sup>His</sup>. [Ref: PubMed 7556055; PubMed 11329259] The locations of Gcn2 residues involved in this study were then projected onto the <underline><italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic></underline> HisRS crystal structure based on the sequence alignment between Gcn2 and authentic HisRSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004991.s003">S3 Fig</xref>.).</p><p>Plasmids employed are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004991.t001">Table 1</xref>. For Gcd<sup>-</sup> mutations identified by random mutagenesis, p2201 was subjected to error-prone PCR mutagenesis using the GeneMorph II kit (Stratagene) by using primer pairs PS-3 (5&#8217;-TCTATTTGATAACTCAGTTCCAAC-3&#8217;) and PS-4 (5&#8217;- TCAGGAATATGTATAAGAAAGGTGAC-3&#8217;). The KpnI-NheI 1.8-kb <italic>GCN2</italic> fragment encoding the HisRS-CTD was isolated from plasmid DNA prepared from a pool of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformants harboring mutagenized plasmids and subcloned into p2201. Plasmid DNA prepared from a pool of the resulting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformants was introduced into yeast strain H1149 and transformants were selected on SC-Ura medium containing 15 mM 3-AT. Resident plasmids were isolated from colony-purified transformants and subjected to DNA sequence analysis to identify the relevant mutations. As multiple mutations generally occurred, QuikChange&#174; site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to produce plasmids pSL501, pSL502 and pSL503, containing only single mutations in <italic>GCN2</italic>. Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to generate the novel derivatives (listed in parenthesis) of the following previously constructed plasmids: p2201 (pSL501-pSL507), p722 (pSL508-pSL525), pHQ430 (pSL535-pSL538), pHQ601 (pSL539-pSL541). Plasmids pSL526, pSL527, pSL529, pSL530 and pSL542 were generated by replacing the 3.0-kb BspEI-NheI fragment in pSL101 or pSL102 with the corresponding fragment from p722 derivatives harboring the appropriate <italic>GCN2</italic> mutations.</p><p>Yeast strains employed included H1149 (<italic>MAT&#945; gcn2&#8710;</italic>::<italic>LEU2 ino1 ura3&#8211;52 leu2&#8211;3 leu2&#8211;112 &lt;HIS4-lacZ&gt;</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004991.ref014">14</xref>], HQY132 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#945; <italic>trp1 ura3 his3 lexAop-LEU2 gcn2&#8710;</italic>::<italic>hisG</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004991.ref024">24</xref>], and H2684 (<italic>MATa ino1 ura3&#8211;52 gcn1&#916; gcn2&#916; gcn20&#916;</italic>) constructed here.</p><p>Transformants of H2684 bearing plasmids pSL101, pSL102, pSL526, pSL527, pSL529, pSL530 and pSL542 were grown to saturation in SC-Ura medium, diluted to A<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 in SC-Ura containing 10% galactose as carbon source and grown to A<sub>600</sub> of &#8764;2.5.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 &#215; g for 2 h at 4&#176;C and mixed with 1 ml of M2-FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) overnight at 4&#176;C.

Immobilization of GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was carried out by incubating the purified fusion proteins at 0.5 &#956;g/&#956;L of beads (bed volume) in buffer A (20mM Tris/HCl pH7.5, 100mM NaCl, 0.2mM EDTA, 1mM DTT) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min with rocking. The beads were washed and resuspended in the same buffer. Five hundred &#956;g of WCE prepared from pHQ311 transformants of HQY132 was treated with 12,000 units of micrococcal nuclease in the presence of 2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 10 min at 37&#176;C. Nuclease-treated WCE was then added to beads (10-&#956;L bed volume) containing 5 &#956;g of bound GST fusion proteins and the volume was increased to 200 &#956;L with buffer A. The mixtures were incubated at 4&#176;C for 2 h with rocking.

The resulting [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS domain fragments were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004991.ref050">50</xref>] and resuspended in 50 &#956;L of buffer A (described above) containing 12.5% glycerol.

The beads were washed and resuspended in the same buffer. Five microliters of [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS domain fragments were added to beads (10-&#956;L bed volume) containing 5 &#956;g of bound GST fusion proteins along with the indicated amount of tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (Sigma-Aldrich, # R4018), or synthetic mRNA (GGAAUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUGCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCUC) synthesized by T7 polymerase as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004991.ref039">39</xref>], and the volume was increased to 200 &#956;L with buffer A.

The beads were collected by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, washed three times with 500 &#956;L of buffer A, resuspended in 40 &#956;L of SDS sample buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. For detecting the [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS domain fragments, the gels were fixed with a solution of isopropanol:water:acetic acid (25:65:10), treated with Amplify (GE Healthcare Life Science), dried, and subjected to fluorography at &#8722;80&#176;C.</p><p>Plasmids encoding the appropriate LexA- and B42-Gcn2 fusions were cotransformed into yeast strain HQY132. The transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan (SC&#8722;Ura&#8722;His&#8722;Trp). Two-hybrid interactions were indicated by &#946;-galactosidase activities in cell extracts of three or more independent transformants. For these assays, cells were grown for 38 h to saturation in SC&#8722;Ura&#8722;His&#8722;Trp and were diluted 1:50 into the same medium containing galactose (2%) and raffinose (1%) as carbon sources (SC/Gal/Raf&#8722;Ura&#8722;His&#8722;Trp). When indicated, sulfometuron was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.5&#956;g/mL. Cells were harvested in the mid-logarithmic phase after 6 h of growth. &#946;-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described above.</p><p>Aliquots of 8 &#956;g of purified Gcn2 were incubated with 0.001 units of elastase (Sigma-Aldrich) or 2 pg of trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 50 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol for 5 min at room temperature and reactions were quenched by adding SDS sample buffer to a final concentration of 1X followed by heat inactivation at 95&#176;C for 5 min.
