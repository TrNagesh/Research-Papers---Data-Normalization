<p>We analyzed family history data for a large number of cases of breast cancer, to compare the risk of breast cancer in the maternal versus the paternal grandmother. The Sister Study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004174-National2">[17]</xref> enrolled 50,884 women aged 35 to 74 in the United States and Puerto Rico between 2004 and 2009; each had a sister diagnosed with breast cancer. The unaffected sisters are being followed for newly incident breast cancer and other conditions. Participants completed a detailed family history questionnaire and were old enough that the data effectively encompass their grandmothers' lifetime risks. The Sister Study secured informed consent and was carried out with human-subjects approval and oversight from the NIEHS Institutional Review Board and the Copernicus Group Institutional Review Board.</p><p>To assess asymmetry, we calculated odds ratios (which approximate the relative risks for maternal versus paternal grandmothers) using families where exactly one of the two grandmothers had breast cancer, i.e., discordant grandmother pairs.</p><p>Using algebra we then derived formulae to assess the likely strength of the mechanisms that could underlie an observed asymmetry in family history. Foreseeing applications beyond breast cancer, we similarly derived expressions to assess the degree of asymmetry that those nonstandard mechanisms would produce in maternal versus paternal progenitors, and the degree of asymmetry produced in the offspring of affected male versus female individuals.</p>
