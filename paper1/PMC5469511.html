<p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">All animal studies were conducted under an animal protocol (ASP-16-086) approved by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Animal Care and Use Committee followed the guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://oacu.oir.nih.gov/animal-research-advisory-committee-guidelines">https://oacu.oir.nih.gov/animal-research-advisory-committee-guidelines</ext-link>).</p><p>The <italic>G6pc</italic>
<sup><italic>fx/fx</italic></sup> mice containing exon 3 of the <italic>G6pc</italic> gene flanked with <italic>loxP</italic> sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref037">37</xref>] were crossed with the SA<sup>creERT2/w</sup> mice expressing a tamoxifen-dependent Cre-recombinase under the control of the serum albumin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref038">38</xref>]. The liver-specific <italic>G6pc</italic>-deficient (L-<italic>G6pc</italic>-/-) and L-<italic>G6pc</italic>+/- mice were generated by tamoxifen-mediated excision of the <italic>G6pc</italic> exon 3 in 6-week-old <italic>G6pc</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup>.SA<sup>creERT2/w</sup> and <italic>G6pc</italic><sup>fx/w</sup>.SA<sup>creERT2/w</sup> mice, respectively, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref003">3</xref>]. GSD-Ia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the phenotypes of L-<italic>G6pc</italic>+/+ and L-<italic>G6pc</italic>+/- were indistinguishable, therefore both mice were used as controls. To reconstitute hepatic G6Pase-&#945; activity, rAAV-G6PC, a rAAV vector expressing human G6Pase-&#945; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref024">24</xref>] at 1 x 10<sup>12</sup> viral particles/kg was infused into L-<italic>G6pc</italic>-/- mice via retro-orbital sinus at 4 WP (weeks post <italic>G6pc</italic> gene deletion). Liver samples were collected from mice at 12WP following a 6-hour fast.</p><p>The recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing human SIRT1 (Ad-SIRT1) and GFP (Ad-GFP) obtained from Vigene Biosciences (Rockville, MD) were amplified using 293 cells and purified via CsCl gradient centrifugation, The CsCl-purified vectors were then dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10% glycerol. Control and L-<italic>G6pc</italic>-/- mice at 12 WP were infused with either Ad-GFP or Ad-SIRT1 via retro-orbital sinus at 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/mice and their phenotype was analyzed at 13 WP. Ad-GFP was used as a control vector. For rapamycin treatment, control and L-<italic>G6pc</italic>-/- mice at 12 WP were injected intraperitoneally with rapamycin (LC Laboratories) at 5 mg/kg body weight in vehicle (1% polyethylene glycol, and 1% Tween-80, Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 consecutive days. As controls, the mice were injected with vehicle alone.</p><p>Autophagic flux determination was performed as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref039">39</xref>]. Briefly, control and L-<italic>G6pc</italic>-/- mice were fasted for 20 hours to induce autophagy pathway. Then, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline or leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich, 40 mg/kg body weight) that blocks lysosomal degradation, and were sacrificed 4 hours later. LC3B-II and &#946;-actin in liver lysates were analyzed by Western blots and quantified by densitometry. The protein levels of LC3B-II were normalized against &#946;-actin. Autophagic flux was determined by the difference in normalized LC3B-II protein levels between in mice treated with saline and in mice treated with leupeptin.</p><p>Liver lysates were deproteinized using 14% (wt/vol) perchloric acid, and then neutralized with 2 M KOH/0.2 M MOPS. The levels of glucose, G6P, and lactate in deproteinized lysates were determined using the respective assay kit from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). Hepatic levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> and triglyceride were determined using the EnzyChrom NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA) and a Triglyceride Quantification Kit (Biovision), respectively. Hepatic glycogen levels, microsome isolation, and G6Pase-&#945; activity assay were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref024">24</xref>].</p><p>Hepatocytes were isolated from control and L-<italic>G6pc</italic>-/- mice at 12 WP using a two-step collagenase perfusion method. Liver was perfused via the portal vein with liver perfusion medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA) for 5 min at 37&#176;C, followed by liver digest medium (Gibco) for 5 min at 37&#176;C. The excised liver was incubated in liver digest medium for 30 min at 37&#176;C, and then passed through a 100 &#956;m cell strainer (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The hepatocytes were pelleted by centrifugation at 4&#176;C, washed twice with hepatocyte wash medium (Gibco), and purified via 20% Percoll gradients (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The resulting hepatocytes were washed with Willams E medium (Gibco) and resuspended in HepatoZYME-SFM (Gibco).</p><p>To determine autophagy vacuoles, 2 X 10<sup>5</sup> hepatocytes were incubated with 1 &#956;l Cyto-ID Green Autophagy detection reagent (Enzo Life Sciences, Exeter, United Kingdom) in 1 ml of HepatoZYME-SFM for 30 min at 37&#176;C, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Guava EasyCyte Mini System (Millipore, St Charles, MO).</p><p>The expression of mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR using the TaqMan probes (Life Technologies) in an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR system. Data were analyzed with the SDS Version1.3 software (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to Rpl19 RNA. Western blot images were detected with the use of the LI-COR Odyssey scanner and the Image studio 3.1 software (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: PARP (#9542), Acetylated-Lysine (#9814), FoxO3a (#12829), Beclin-1 (#3738), ATG3 (#3415), ATG101 (#13492), BNIP3 (#12396), ATG7 (#8558), mTOR (#2983), p-mTOR-S2448 (#5536), and p-mTOR-S2481 (#2974). The antibodies were purchased from Abcam: LC3B (ab51520), p62 (ab91526), ATG14 (ab139727), and TFEB (ab122910). The antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: ATG5 (sc-515347), &#946;-actin (sc-47778), PPAR-&#947; (sc-7196), and PPAR-&#945; (sc-9000). SIRT1 (#07&#8211;131) antibody was purchased from Millipore. The monoclonal antibody against human G6Pase-&#945; was raised in mice using a peptide containing amino acid residues 227 to 268 in luminal loop 3 of human G6Pase-&#945; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006819.ref040">40</xref>]. Antigen injection, hybridoma generation, and clone screening were performed by A&amp;G Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hybridoma clones were screened using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the immunogen. The culture supernatant from a hybridoma clone (3A9) showing high sensitivity to the immunogen was subjected to affinity purification using the peptide coupled agarose. The specificity of the purified antibody was confirmed by ELISA.</p><p>Liver tissues were homogenized with the IP lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA and 5% glycerol) containing 1 X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails (Thermo Scientific) and centrifuged at 12000 g for 20 min at 4&#176;C. The resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibody. To detect acetylated FoxO3a, liver nuclear extracts prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against FoxO3a (Cell Signaling) and the resulting precipitates were examined by Western blot analysis with the antibody against acetylated lysine (Cell Signaling).</p><p>Mouse livers were fixed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. The fixed liver tissues were then treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer and 2% uranyl acetate for 1 h at room temperature. The liver tissues were then serially dehydrated by ethanol, and then serially infiltrated via Spurr&#8217;s resin/ethanol up to 100% resin which was then polymerized for 18 h at 70&#176;C in a Pelco BioWave Pro microwave oven (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), and finally cut into 90 nm sections using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut-E ultramicrotome. The resulting grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and imaged with a JEOL-1400 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.</p><p>Mouse liver tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY), embedded in paraffin, then sectioned to 10 &#956;m thickness, and the paraffin was removed by Xylene (Fisher Scientific). Liver sections were then incubated in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 10 min at 100&#176;C. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 0.9% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, and then blocked with the Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories). The sections were then incubated with the anti-ChREBP (NOVUS) antibody and followed with the biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). The resulting complexes were detected with an ABC kit using the DAB Substrate (Vector Laboratories). Sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope equipped with 10X/0.45NA, 20X/0.5NA or 40X/0.75NA objectives (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Nuclear translocalization of ChREBP was quantified by calculating the percentages of hepatocytes containing ChREBP-positive nuclei in 10 randomly selected fields of the livers stained with ChREBP antibody at 400 x magnification.</p><p>The unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was performed by using the GraphPad Prism Program, version 4 (San Diego, CA). The values were considered statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
