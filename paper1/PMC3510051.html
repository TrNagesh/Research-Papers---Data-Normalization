Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Confocal microscopy was conducted using BioRad 2000, Leica SP2 or Leica SP5 instruments. Single channels were collected and analyzed separately in NIH ImageJ1.6 software, and figures were arranged in Photoshop.</p><p>Eye imaginal discs were dissected and separated from antennal discs in PBS buffer and transferred to 4 ml Trypsin EDTA (Sigma) in PBS, containing Draq5 (diluted 1&#8758;500; Bio Status Limited) in batches of 10&#8211;20 and dissociated as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-delaCruz1">[47]</xref>. Partial dissociated samples were imaged for 30&#8211;45 minutes after 90 minutes of gentle nutation at room temperature, and discs were fully dissociated after 150 minutes of gentle nutation. Epi-fluorescence imaging was carried out using on DeltaVision Core, with an mCherry/GFP filter set.</p>
