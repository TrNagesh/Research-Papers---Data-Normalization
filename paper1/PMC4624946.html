<p>All animal procedures were in accordance with the United Kingdom Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986 and were subject to local ethical review.</p><p>Females were set up in matings and checked daily for copulation plugs. The day of plugging was considered 0.5 days <italic>post coitum</italic> (d<italic>pc</italic>). Embryos were sacrificed at 17.5, 18.5, 19.5 and 20.5 d<italic>pc</italic> using UK Home Office Schedule I methods. Ovaries were dissected from embryos and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Material was stored at -80&#176;C until later use. All mice were maintained according to UK Home Office regulations. XO mice were generated on a random bred MF1 background (NIMR stock) by mating XX females to fertile X<sup>Y</sup>*O males, which harbor an X chromosome fused with a Y chromosome and give rise to &#8216;O&#8217; gametes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref049">49</xref>]. T(16;17)43H mice were maintained on a C57BL/10ScSnPh (B10) background, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref047">47</xref>]. <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref050">50</xref>] were generated on the MF1 background. XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> mice were generated by crossing X<sup>Y</sup>O <italic>H2afx+/-</italic> males with XX <italic>H2afx+/-</italic> females. <italic>Dmc1-/-</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref038">38</xref>] were produced on a C57BL/6 background. Tc1 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref051">51</xref>] were maintained on the MF1 background. The C57BL/6 males used in this cross were maintained on-site at NIMR. XXY <sup>d1</sup> females were produced on an MF1 background by mating XY males to sex-reversed XY<sup>d1</sup> females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref035">35</xref>]. Mice carrying the <italic>H2afx</italic>

The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescent experiments: rabbit anti-SYCP3 (1:100, Abcam: ab15093), mouse anti-&#947;H2AFX (1:100, Upstate: 16&#8211;193; 1:100), guinea pig and rabbit anti-HORMAD1 and anti-HORMAD2 (ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref012">12</xref>], 1:200), rabbit anti-RPA32/RPA2 (Abcam, ab-10359; 1:100), rabbit anti-BRCA1 (1:100, gift from Chu-Xia Deng), goat anti-ATR (1:50, Santa Cruz: sc-1887). Primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 37&#176;C and secondary antibody incubations for 1hr at 37&#176;C. For chromosome spread analyses, oocytes were first categorized into meiotic substages based upon SYCP3 and HORMAD1 staining, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005462.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. After the meiotic substage was determined, the oocytes were then assessed for &#947;H2AFX domains or HORMAD2 axial staining (for XO <italic>H2afx</italic>-/- experiments). For quantification of the &#947;H2AFX signal in spread oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005462.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), images were taken with matched exposure times. We calculated the integrated intensity of &#947;H2AFX domain area using Fiji software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref054">54</xref>]. For each image we estimated background intensity in a region outside of the nucleus. We then calculated the background-adjusted intensity value of the &#947;H2AFX domains by subtracting the background equal to the area of the &#947;H2AFX domain.</p><p>Ovaries were harvested from females at 20.5 days <italic>post-coitum</italic> (d<italic>pc</italic>), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4&#176;C and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Fixed ovaries were dehydrated by three successive 5min incubations with 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 100% xylene and were then embedded in paraffin wax. Ovaries were serially sectioned at 5&#8211;7&#956;m thickness. Sections were dewaxed using histoclear (2x5min) and 1:1 histoclear:ethanol (1x5min), and then rehydrated using the following ethanol series: 100% ethanol (2x5min), 95% ethanol (1x5min), 80% (1x5min), 70% (1x5min), 50% (1x3min), and PBS (1x5min). Sections were stained with DAPI and oocytes were identified based upon their distinct size and nuclear cytology, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref023">23</xref>]. To quantify the relative number of oocytes in each ovary, we summed the oocyte counts from every tenth section, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref019">19</xref>].</p><p>Tunel analysis was performed using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase <italic>In Situ</italic>, Apoptosis Detection Kit, S710, Millipore, according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. For statistical comparison of means, a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test (for &gt;1 comparisons) or an unpaired t test (for one comparison) was performed. Calculated P values are reported in figures or legends.</p><p>Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with a 100-W mercury arc lamp. For chromosome spread and RNA FISH imaging, an Olympus UPlanApo 100x/1.35 NA oil immersion objective was used. For ovary section imaging, an Olympus UPlanApo 20x/0.75 NA objective was used. A Deltavision RT computer-assisted Photometrics CoolsnapHQ CCD camera with an ICX285 Progressive scan CCD image sensor was utilized for image capture. 16-bit (1024x1024 pixels) raw images of each channel were captured and later processed using Fiji. Quantitation of Cot1 and &#947;H2AFX intensities was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005462.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
