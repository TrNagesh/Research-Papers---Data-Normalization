<p>The GA-1 strain of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> was used in this study. Beetles were reared at 30&#176;C under standard conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002682-Beeman1">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Elytra of newly emerged adults (n&#8202;=&#8202;10) were homogenized in 100 &#181;l of cold PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 4&#176;C. The supernatant was collected as PBS soluble fraction. The pellet was homogenized in 100 &#181;l of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 95&#176;C for 10 min, centrifuged for 2 min. The supernatant was collected as PBS pellet fraction. Protein extracts were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE or 4&#8211;12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were digested with trypsin, and the resulting fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.</p><p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">After staining gels with Coomassie G-250, the selected gel band was excised as 1&#8211;2 mm diameter pieces and transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. A protein-free region of the gel was also excised as background control. The control and test gel sections were destained using three 30 min washes of 60 &#181;L 1&#8758;1 acetonitrile: water at 30&#176;C. Gel pieces were then dried for 10 min under vacuum. The gel sections were subjected to reduction and alkylation using 50 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 55&#176;C for 10 min followed by 100 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at 30&#176;C for 60 min. The carboxymethylated gels were thoroughly washed and re-dried <italic>in vacuo</italic>, then incubated with sequencing grade trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega, Madison, WI), 20 ng/&#181;L in 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate, in 20 &#181;L. Upon rehydration of the gels, an additional 15 &#181;L of 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10% acetonitrile was added, and gel sections were incubated at 30&#176;C for 17 h in sealed Eppendorf tubes. The aqueous digestion solutions were transferred to clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, and tryptic fragments remaining within the gel sections were recovered by a single extraction with 50 &#181;l of 50% acetonitrile and 2% trifluoracetic acid (TFA) at 30&#176;C for 1 h. The acetonitrile fractions were combined with previous aqueous fractions and the liquid was removed by speed vacuum concentration. The dried samples were resuspended in 10 &#181;L of 30 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxylbenzonic acid (DHB) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 33% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and 2 &#181;L of peptide/matrix solution was applied on a Bruker Massive Aluminum plate for MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF analysis. Mass spectra and tandem mass spectra were obtained on a Bruker Ultraflex II TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. Positively charged ions were analyzed in the reflector mode. MS and MS/MS spectra were analyzed with Flex analysis 3.0 and Bio Tools 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). Measurements were externally calibrated with 8 different peptides ranging from 757.39 to 3147.47 (Peptide Calibration Standard I, Bruker Daltonics) and internally recalibrated with peptides from the autoproteolysis of trypsin. Peptide ion searches were performed with Beetlebase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.bioinformatics.ksu.edu/BeetleBase/">http://www.bioinformatics.ksu.edu/BeetleBase/</ext-link>) (as well as Metazoa domain_201000104 in NCBInr database) using MASCOT software (Matrix Science). The following parameters were used for the database search: MS and MS/MS accuracies were set to &lt;0.5 Da, trypsin/P as an enzyme, missed cleavages 1, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. Sequence motif analysis of the predicted protein sequence was searched in motifs database including PROSITE profiles and Pfam HMMs.</p><p>The full-length coding sequences for <italic>TcCPR27</italic> and <italic>TcCPR18</italic> (351 bp and 504 bp, respectively) were amplified from total RNA extracted from pupae (mixture of 0 d- to 5 d-old pupae) by RT-PCR.
