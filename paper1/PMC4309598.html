Tamoxifen was injected for 5 consecutive days.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004877.ref009">9</xref>]. Briefly, skin samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes at 110&#176;C in HistoPro (Rapid Microwave Histoprocessor, Milestone, USA). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Sox10 (goat, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Sox10 (mouse, 1:200, R&amp;D), anti-Sox9 (rabbit, 1:100, sc-20095, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Sox9 (rabbit, 1:100, ab36748, Abcam), anti-Sox9 (M00006662, Abnova), anti-Sox9 (AB5535, Millipore), anti-Sox9 (GTX 109661, GenTex), anti-MITF (mouse, clone 6D3, 1:500) was a kind gift from Heinz Arnheiter (NIH, USA). Images were captured with a Leica DMI 6000B Microscope and using LAS AF (Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence) software. For whole mount X-Gal staining, skin samples were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and subjected to X-Gal staining solution overnight at 37&#176;C. After several washing steps, tissue was paraffin embedded and sectioned. 5 &#956;m thick sections were further counterstained with eosin solution and mounted.</p><p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (Invitrogen). 1 &#956;g aliquots of RNA were reverse transcribed with Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Data collection and analysis were performed by ABI Viia7 Fast Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression values of averaged triplicate reactions were normalized to <italic>RPL28</italic> expression levels. RPL28 primers are as follows: 5&#8217;-GCAATTGGTTCCGCTACAAC-3&#8217; and 5&#8217;-TGTTCTTGCGGATCATGTGT-3&#8217;. The expression of SOX10 and SOX9 was measured using primers purchased from QIAGEN: SOX10 (Hs_SOX10_1_SG); SOX9 (Hs_SOX9_1_SG).</p><p>Cells derived from patients with giant congenital naevi were sequenced for NRAS. Primers for sequencing for Exon 1 (mutation G12) and Exon 2 (mutation Q61K) of NRAS gene were as follows: NRAS_1F 5&#8217;-ATAGAAAGCTTTAAAGTACTG-3&#8217; and NRAS_1R 5&#8217;-TTCCTTTAATACAGAATATGG-3&#8217;, NRAS_2F 5&#8217;-CCCCTTACCCTCCACAC-3&#8217; and NRAS_2R 5&#8217;-AACCTAAAACCAACTCTTCCCA-3&#8217;.</p><p>Silencing RNA (siRNA) transfection was carried out using INTERFERin transfection solution according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol (Polyplus-transfection, Illkirch, France). Cells were transfected with 10 nM of siRNA (Qiagen) for 96 hours before RNA was extracted or used for FACS analysis. As control siRNA, the All-Star negative siRNA sequence (Qiagen) was used, and gene-specific siRNAs targeting siSOX10 (SI00729414, SI00729421) and siSOX9 (SI00007595, SI00007609) were obtained from Qiagen. Transfection of DNA was carried using JetPEI transfection solution according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol (Polyplus-transfection, Illkirch, France). Cells were transfected with 1 ug of pCMV6-SOX9 (Origene SC321884) or empty vector for 96 hours before RNA was extracted or used for FACS analysis.</p><p>Melanocytes were purified by FACS from doxycycline-treated iDct-GFP mice as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004877.ref041">41</xref>]. Total RNA was prepared from FACS-sorted cell fractions containing GFP-positive melanoblasts/melanocytes according to standard Illumina RNA-Seq paired-end protocol and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx to 80 bp per read.</p><p>Total RNA was isolated from melanoma cell cultures using TRIzol according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (Invitrogen). Total RNA was amplified and biotin-labelled using the Message Amp II-Biotin Enhanced aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Biotin-labelled RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays following the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After hybridization, microarrays were washed and stained using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) and then scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 7G (Affymetrix). Raw data was processed by R using the affycoretools package (RMA). Gene expression datasets for SOX10 knockdown were obtained from NCBI GEO GSE37059. Gene expression analysis was performed by R using the limma package. P-values were adjusted by FDR p-value adjustment. For melanoma cell lines analysis (proliferative vs invasive): Normalized expression values were downloaded from GSE4840 containing microarray data for twenty three melanoma cell cultures. Pearson&#8217;s product moment correlation (r) was calculated for the SOX10 and SOX9 expression values across all twenty three samples. P-value was determined from the t statistic calculated from r.</p><p>Skin tissue (from back skin) was digested with a mixture of Dispase (Roche) and Collagenase I (Worthington) for 1 hour at 37&#176;C and enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of DMEM media supplemented with 10%FCS as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004877.ref009">9</xref>]. Subsequently, single cell suspension was filtered through 40 &#956;m strainers (BD). For cell cycle analysis, Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Invitrogen) was used. Cells were labeled with PI according to manufacturer&#8217;s protocol and DNA content was measured using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and a BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). For measurement of apoptosis, Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, 559763) was used. FACSAria sorter and FACS DiVa software (BD Biosciences) were used for cell sorting.</p><p>ChIP analysis was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004877.ref062">62</xref>]. Sox9 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-20095, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SOX10 promoter sequences were amplified with forward primer (5&#8217;-CCTCTGCCTCGTGTGACTAC-3&#8217;) and reverse primer (5&#8217;-TCCTGTCTGGAGTGGGCTG-3&#8217;).</p>
