<p><italic>HOX</italic> and <italic>CTCF</italic> coding sequences were amplified from chicken embryonic limb buds cDNA (HH27) and cloned into RCASBP-viruses as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006567.ref018">18</xref>]. DF1 cells were transfected in a 6 cm dish with 3 &#956;g of each RCASBP(A) plasmid using Polyethylenimine (Polyscience Inc. #24765&#8211;2) and NaCl. Cells were expanded and stressed on starvation media whereupon the supernatant was harvested on three consecutive days. The supernatant was then centrifuged to produce the concentrated viral particles of high titer, 10<sup>8</sup> viral particles/ml or higher. The infection of chMM cultures and the histological assessment were performed as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006567.ref018">18</xref>]. For the quantification of chondrogenesis, cultures after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days post-infection were fixed and stained with Alcian Blue. After 2 washes with 1 x PBS, the quantification of incorporated Alcian Blue was determined by extraction with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, followed by photometric measurement at A 595 nm. The expression level of cloned constructs was controlled with Western Blot. Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer and immunoblotted using m-&#945;FLAG M2 1:1,000 (Sigma, F1804) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006567.s001">S1D Fig</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006567.ref018">18</xref>]. Briefly, chMM cultures were harvested after 6 days of culture by adding digestion solution (0.1% collagenase (Sigma, #C9891) and 0.1% Trypsin in 1x PBS) to obtain a roughly single-cell suspension. Cells were taken up in 10 ml cold chMM (DMEM: HAMF11 with 10% FBS, 10% CS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin) medium and fixed for 10 min on ice with 1% formaldehyde. The extraction of nuclear lysate was performed as described in Lee, Johnstone (37) and chromatin was sonicated with a Diagenode Bioruptor (45 cycles&#8212;30-sec pulse, 30-sec pause, HI power). For ChIP, 25&#8211;35 &#956;g of chromatin was incubated with 6&#8211;8 &#956;g of antibody overnight. The next day blocked magnetic beads were added and incubated overnight, followed by 6 washes with RIPA and one with TE buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006567.ref037">37</xref>]. After elution, the preparation of the library for pulled down DNA was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006567.ref018">18</xref>].</p><p>Cells from harvested chMM cultures were separated prior to fixation of the ChIP samples and RNA was isolated from these cells using an RNaeasy Qiagen kit. RNA-seq libraries were constructed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006567.ref018">18</xref>], by selecting for fragment sizes between 300&#8211;500 bp and sequenced single-end 50 bp using Illumina technology.</p><p>DF1 cells were transfected with RCASBP(A)-3x FLAG-HOXA10, RCASBP(A)-3x FLAG-HOXD13, or RCASBP(B)-HA-CTCF, respectively. The cells were cultured for at least 6 days to ensure a high cellular infection rate. Upon confluency cells were transferred to 10 mm cover slips and further incubated for one day. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA, blocked with TSA (10% horse serum, 0,5% PerkinElmer blocking reagent [#FP1020] and 0.01% Triton-X-100 in 1x DPBS) and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (in 10% horse serum in 1x DPBST) overnight at 4&#176;C. Primary antibody combinations were: 1) FLAG-HOX and CTCF interaction: m-&#945;FLAG M2 and rb-&#945;CTCF; and 2) HA-CTCF and RAD21 interaction: m-&#945;HA and rb-&#945;RAD21. Antibody concentration for PLA were tested and used as follows: m-&#945;FLAG M2 1:20,000 (Sigma, F1804), m-&#945;HA.11 1:8,000 (BioLegends, #901501), rb-&#945;CTCF 1:20,000 (ActiveMotif, #61311) and rb-&#945;RAD21 1:1,000 (Abcam, ab992).</p><p>After primary antibody incubation, the PLA assay was performed using the Duolink In Situ Fluorescence Kit (Sigma, #DUO92101-1KT) according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by using confocal imaging on a Zeiss LSM700 and the Axiovert Zen software.</p><p>For the quantification of PLA experiments, the contacts in several independent frames were counted using ImageJ and divided by the number of nuclei in the frame. The PLA experiments were performed in at least two independent experiments.</p>
