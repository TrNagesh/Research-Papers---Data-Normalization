<p>Flies were reared at 25&#176;C on standard cornmeal agar medium. Stocks possessing <italic>P</italic> element and <italic>Minos</italic> insertions were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center or from the lab of Hugo Bellen. In some instances, <italic>P</italic> elements were crossed to a <italic>&#916;2&#8211;3</italic> transposase source in a <italic>mus309<sup>N1</sup></italic> mutant background to generate large deletion mutations, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002659-Witsell1">[42]</xref>. The <italic>mus309<sup>N1</sup></italic> mutation was removed before further experimentation.</p><p>For all tests, heterozygous mutants were mated in vials containing 5 mL of food and allowed to lay eggs for three days before being transferred to fresh vials for two additional days. One group of vials was treated with 250 &#181;L of mutagen solution, while the other was treated with the same volume of vehicle control. For ionizing radiation studies, embryos were collected on grape-juice agar plates for 12 hours and allowed to develop to third instar larvae, then irradiated in a Gammator 1000 irradiator. For all other mutagens, progeny were treated as first instar larvae. Vehicle control was H<sub>2</sub>0 for all treatments except for camptothecin, in which DMSO in a 20% Tween, EtOH solution was used. Percent survival relative to control was calculated as the ratio of the percentage of homozygotes that eclosed in the treatment group relative to the expected number based on homozygote survival in the control group. Each experiment consisted of at least five independent vials, and error bars represent standard deviations of at least three independent replicates.</p><p>HR repair was monitored through the DSB created after excision of a <italic>P{w<sup>a</sup>}</italic> element as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002659-McVey2">[43]</xref> and see text). A second chromosome transposase source <italic>(CyO, H{w+,&#916;2&#8211;3})</italic> was used to excise <italic>P{w<sup>a</sup>}</italic> for <italic>rev1</italic> and <italic>pol eta</italic> single mutants, whereas all other experiments were performed with a third chromosome transposase source (<italic>P{ry+, &#916;2&#8211;3}</italic>). Matched wildtype controls using the appropriate transposase source were done for each experiment (the same representative control for each respective transposase source is indicated throughout). Individual males possessing both <italic>P{w<sup>a</sup>}</italic> and the transposase source were mated to females homozygous for <italic>P{w<sup>a</sup>}</italic> and repair products were recovered in female progeny. Each vial was counted as an independent sample and statistical significance was calculated using the Mann-Whitney statistical test. Genomic DNA from flies possessing independent repair events was recovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002659-Gloor1">[44]</xref> and PCR was carried out to estimate the extent of repair synthesis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002659.s005">Text S1</xref>). Control tract lengths were obtained from excisions using the third chromosome transposase source.</p>
