<p>K562 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Murine ESCs were maintained at a density between 1&#215;10<sup>5</sup> and 5&#215;10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in 5% CO2 at 37&#176;C as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Shen3">[56]</xref>. Constructs used for shRNA expression were generated by subcloning shRNA oliginucleotides into the pSuper.retro.puro vector following the manufacturer's instruction (Oligoengine). Infectious viruses were produced in PhoenixA package cells using calcium phosphate transfection; supernatant was collected after 48 hrs post-transfection to infect cells, and cells were selected by puromycin resistance.</p><p>The AUSF1 transgenic mice have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Liang1">[34]</xref>. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC committee and conform to the regulatory guidelines. The pcDNA4-AUSF1 expressing construct was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Li1">[31]</xref>. The pcDNA3.1-Flag-USF1 expressing vector was cloned by fusing Flag tag to the N-terminal of human USF1 cDNA. ESCs were transfected with these plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and selected with 400 ng/ml Zeocin for AUSF1 and with 500 &#181;g/ml G418 for Flag-tagged USF1 (Invitrogen). For luciferase reporter assays, K562 cells were transfected with a pREP4-hHoxB4-luc reporter, an expression vector for USF1, AUSF1, or siRNAs targeting individual components of the hSET1A complex, hSET1A, HCF1, or ASH2L. A CMV-driven renilla luciferase plasmid was used as transfection control. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 hrs and subjected to luciferase and ChIP assays.</p><p>
<italic>In vitro</italic> hematopoietic differentiation of ESCs was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Shen3">[56]</xref> with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003524.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Briefly, mESCs were dispersed into single cell suspension by trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin and resuspended in EB media (IMDM supplemented with 15% FBS, 180 mg/ml transferrin, 4.5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> M (MTG), 50 ng/ml ascorbic acid, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) with 5&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml. 20 &#181;l of a drop containing 1000 ESCs were seeded on the cover of the tissue culture dish by the hanging drop method. The EBs were collected for suspension culture in polyHEMA-coated dishes on day 3. The EBs were then supplemented with 40 ng/ml SCF on day 4. Fresh media containing 40 ng/ml mSCF, 20 ng/ml IL3, and IL6 (Peprotech) was replaced on day 7 and then changed with fresh media every two days. The EBs were harvested at different time points, and single cell suspensions were prepared for FACS analysis, RNA extraction, and ChIP.</p><p>FLAG tagged cDNAs encoding hSET1A, ASH2L, WDR5, RBBP5 and HCF1 were cloned into the pFastBac1 vector as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Dou1">[14]</xref> and proteins were expressed in SF9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Flag tagged fusion proteins were purified by FLAG immunoaffinity purification as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Dou1">[14]</xref>. To reconstitute the hSET1A core complex, SF9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged hSET1A, ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, and HCF1. The GST-pull down assay was carried out as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Li1">[31]</xref>. Briefly, equal amounts of GST-USF1 fusion protein was incubated with reconstituted hSET1A core complex or individual components of the complex in 500 &#181;l binding buffer (PBS, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) at RT for 1 hour and proteins were captured by glutathione beads preconjugated with GST-USF1. Captured proteins were washed three times and detected by western blotting (WB).</p><p>Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Li1">[31]</xref>. USF1 (H-86), MLLn, and MLLc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). hSET1A (A300-289A, A300-290A), RbBP5 (A300-109A), ASH2L (A300-489A), HCF1 (A301-399A), and TAF3 antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Mouse FLAG antibody was bought from Sigma.</p><p>Single cell suspensions obtained from E10.5 yolk sacs of the AUSF1 embryos treated with collagenase (Stem Cell Technologies) was subjected to FACS analysis using antibody against CD117 PE (c-Kit) (BD Biosciences). Single cell suspension obtained from differentiated EBs was subjected to FACS analysis using antibodies against CD117 PE (c-Kit), Sca-1 PE-cy7, CD41 FIFC (BD Biosciences), CD117 FIFC, or Tie2 PE (eBioscience). Briefly, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS, passed through a 70-&#181;m cell strainer, and incubated on ice with indicated antibodies for 30 min. After a series of washes to remove unbound antibodies, cells were subjected to FACS using a BD LSRII system (BD Biosciences).</p><p>Total RNA was prepared by using the RNeasy mini isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen, MD, USA). 1 &#181;g RNA was reverse transcribed by using the Superscript II reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using a CFX 96 real time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are listed in the Supplemental Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003524.s010">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>ChIP assays were performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Li1">[31]</xref> using antibodies specific for transcription factors, modifying enzymes, and various histone modifications. Antibodies against RNAPII, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were purchased from Millipore (Millipore). Other antibodies were described above. The relative enrichment was determined by the following equation: <underline>2<italic><sup>Ct(IP)&#8722;Ct(Ref)</sup></italic>.</underline> In addition, Micro-ChIP was used to analyze EBs (1&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells/IP) using Dynal bead conjugated protein A or protein G (Invitrogen).</p><p>The sequential ChIP assays were carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Li2">[32]</xref> with minor modifications. Briefly, chromatin prepared from 3&#215;10<sup>6</sup> cells was first immunoprecipitated with USF1 or H3K27me3 antibody. The USF1 or H3K27me3 selected chromatin complexes were eluted, dialyzed, and subsequently immunoprecipitated with hSET1A or H3K4me3 antibody, respectively. The bound protein-DNA complexes were reverse cross-linked, purified, and analyzed by qPCR.</p><p>Primary human CD34+ cells were isolated and differentiated to CD36+ cells as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Cui1">[10]</xref>. ChIP-Seq and RNA-seq assays were performed as outlined previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Cui1">[10]</xref> and described briefly below. For ChIP-Seq analysis, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, followed by sonication to fragment chromatin to sizes ranging from 200 to 500 bp. Chromatin fractions from 1 to 5 million cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation using 2 micrograms of specific antibodies. Following reverse cross-linking and purification, the ChIP DNA was ligated to Illumina ChIP-Seq adaptors, amplified using the Illumina primers, and sequenced on the Illumina GAII platform. For RNA-Seq assays, total RNA was isolated from cells and reverse transcribed. The cDNA samples were fragmented to 100 to 300 bp by sonication, ligated to Illumina adaptor, and sequenced on the GAII platform, similar to the ChIP-Seq libraries. Sequence reads of 25-bp were obtained, mapped to the human genome (hg18) and processed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003524-Barski1">[57]</xref>. The sequence reads have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (GSE12646).</p>
