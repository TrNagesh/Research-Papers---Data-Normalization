<p>The Animal Care and Use Committees of St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital (approval number 319), and Regional Ethics board in North Stockholm approved all of the protocols performed in this study. Mice were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Toe clipping and genotyping was performed in accordance with <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic>.</p><p>All FRAP experiments using isolated OHCs in this study was prepared from mice at postnatal 18&#8211;22 days of age. Dissociation of OHCs was described in Supplementary Methods. The isolated OHCs were put in the Petri dishes. The extracellular solution used was 155mM NaCl, 4mM KCl, 2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM HEPES. The osmolarity and pH was adjusted to 320&#8211;330 mOsm/kg and 7.3. A criterion of healthy OHCs was cylinder-shaped. Although internalization of membrane inside of OHC was occasionally observed, those cells were not chosen. Occasionally, OHCs became swollen in the course of experiments. These data were discarded. All of data were recorded within two hours after sacrificing mice. FRAP experiment was performed using Spinning Disk Confocal microscope system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO, USA) with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63 &#215; oil immersion and 1.4 NA objective (Zeiss), Yokogawa CSU-X1 Spinning Disk (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan), 3iLaser stack (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.) and Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ, USA). Photobleaching was performed with a circular spot using 514 nm laser for Slc26a5-YFP, 488 nm laser for Arch-EGFP-ER2 and mGFP, 561 nm laser for ChR2-tdTomato and mtdTomato. The laser power for photobleaching was adjusted to photobleach approximately 50&#8211;75% fluorescence intensity. Each image was captured with 75 ms exposure time for Slc26a5-YFP in <italic>Slc26a5</italic>

These values were background-subtracted. The intensity of un-photobleached area at each time point was used to correct acquisition photobleach. Normalized intensity at each time (t) was obtained by using the following equation:

After a 3D reconstruction of isolated OHCs, the OHC lengths and diameters were measured as OHC lengths and diameters drawing a line along Slc26a5 are expressing region, using the Imaris 8. 1. 0. software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005500.s010">S10 Fig</xref>.

Briefly, isolated OHCs were placed in extracellular solution containing drugs indicated in each figure. 20 min after the incubation, protein&#8217;s mobility was measured (see above).</p><p>B &amp; N experiments were performed on isolated preparations of the mouse temporal bone. Following induction of anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Apoteket, Stockholm, Sweden), the animal was decapitated and the temporal bone excised and placed in tissue culture medium (140 mM D-gluconic acid, 6.6 mM NaCl, 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM D-glucose, and 5 mM HEPES (298 mOsm, pH 7.3)). The auditory bulla was then opened and the tympanic membrane removed after carefully disarticulating the incudo-stapedial joint. The preparation was mounted in a custom holder. To maintain cellular viability, a thin piece of plastic tubing was inserted into scala tympani after peeling away the round window membrane. The outlet of the tissue culture medium was through a second opening at the apex of the cochlea. This opening also made it possible to visualize the organ of Corti.</p><p>Confocal images were with a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope equipped with a 40x 0.8 NA water immersion objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), operating in the photon-counting mode using the HyD detectors. YFP was excited with the 514 nm line of the build in Argon ion laser. Time series, consisting of 225 images, each 256 x 256 pixels, were acquired with a line frequency of 100 Hz and without inter-frame delay. Data analysis was performed using Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Briefly, obtained intensity at each data point for each pixel was extracted to obtain the average intensity (&lt;&#956;&gt;) and the variance (&#963;<sup>2</sup>). By dividing the variance of the pixel values along the time dimension with the average intensity, a map of mobile molecules within the preparation (&#963;<sup>2</sup>/&#956;) were obtained.</p><p>For ultrastructural analysis in isolated OHCs, carbon coated-sapphire discs (LEICA) with the pattern of a finder grid were used to identify locations of isolated OHCs on the discs. The sapphire discs were further coated with poly-L-lysine (SIGMA). Isolated OHCs were prepared as described above, placed on the discs, and treated with either 10 mM salicylate, 1 mM M&#946;CD, or both 10 mM salicylate and 1 mM M&#946;CD in extracellular solution described above for 20 min at room temperature. As a control, the OHC was incubated in extracellular solution with no drugs for 20 min at room temperature. The OHCs were fixed using freshly-prepared fixative solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde, and post-fixed with OsO<sub>4</sub>. After dehydration, the discs were embedded with epon resin. The discs were lifted up and peeled off the blocks after the embedding blocks were trimmed. Images of the thick sections were collected for inspection by a JEOL 1200-EX (JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA) electron microscope operated at 100 kV at up to 50,000 x magnification.</p>
